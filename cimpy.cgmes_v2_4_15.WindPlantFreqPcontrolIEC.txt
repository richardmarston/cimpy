      Frequency and active power controller model.  Reference: IEC
      Standard 61400-27-1 Annex E.

      WindDynamicsLookupTable:
         The frequency and active power wind plant control model with
         which this wind dynamics lookup table is associated. Default:
         "list"

      dprefmax:
         Maximum ramp rate of  request from the plant controller to
         the wind turbines (). It is project dependent parameter.
         Default: 0.0

      dprefmin:
         Minimum (negative) ramp rate of  request from the plant
         controller to the wind turbines (). It is project dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      kiwpp:
         Plant P controller integral gain (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      kpwpp:
         Plant P controller proportional gain (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      prefmax:
         Maximum  request from the plant controller to the wind
         turbines (). It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      prefmin:
         Minimum  request from the plant controller to the wind
         turbines (). It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      tpft:
         Lead time constant in reference value transfer function ().
         It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      tpfv:
         Lag time constant in reference value transfer function (). It
         is type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      twpffilt:
         Filter time constant for frequency measurement (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

      twppfilt:
         Filter time constant for active power measurement (). It is
         type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      WindPlantIEC:
         Wind plant model with which this wind plant frequency and
         active power control is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
