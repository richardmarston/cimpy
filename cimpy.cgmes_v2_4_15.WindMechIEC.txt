class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.WindMechIEC.WindMechIEC(WindGenTurbineType3IEC=None, cdrt=0.0, hgen=0, hwtr=0, kdrt=0.0, WindTurbineType4bIEC=None, WindTurbineType1or2IEC=None, *args, **kw_args)

      Two mass model.  Reference: IEC Standard 61400-27-1 Section
      6.6.2.1.

      WindGenTurbineType3IEC:
         Wind turbine Type 3 model with which this wind mechanical
         model is associated. Default: None

      cdrt:
         Drive train damping (. It is type dependent parameter.
         Default: 0.0

      hgen:
         Inertia constant of generator (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0

      hwtr:
         Inertia constant of wind turbine rotor (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

      kdrt:
         Drive train stiffness (). It is type dependent parameter.
         Default: 0.0

      WindTurbineType4bIEC:
         Wind turbine type 4B model with which this wind mechanical
         model is associated. Default: None

      WindTurbineType1or2IEC:
         Wind generator type 1 or 2 model with which this wind
         mechanical model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
