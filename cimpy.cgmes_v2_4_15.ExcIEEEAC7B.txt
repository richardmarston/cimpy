      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC7B model. The
      model represents excitation systems which consist of an ac
      alternator with either stationary or rotating rectifiers to
      produce the dc field requirements. It is an upgrade to earlier
      ac excitation systems, which replace only the controls but
      retain the ac alternator and diode rectifier bridge.  Reference:
      IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 6.7.  In the IEEE Standard
      421.5 - 2005, the [1 / sT] block is shown as [1 / (1 + sT)],
      which is incorrect.

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global

         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
