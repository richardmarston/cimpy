class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PowerTransformer.PowerTransformer(PowerTransformerEnd='list', beforeShCircuitHighestOperatingCurrent=0.0, beforeShCircuitHighestOperatingVoltage=0.0, beforeShortCircuitAnglePf=0.0, highSideMinOperatingU=0.0, isPartOfGeneratorUnit=False, operationalValuesConsidered=False, *args, **kw_args)

      An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled
      windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing
      mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be
      used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow). A
      power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks
      that need not be identical. A power transformer can be modeled
      with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced
      and unbalanced representations.   A power transformer typically
      has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more
      terminals. The inherited association
      ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.  The
      association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used
      instead.

      PowerTransformerEnd:
         The power transformer of this power transformer end. Default:
         "list"

      beforeShCircuitHighestOperatingCurrent:
         The highest operating current (Ib in the IEC 60909-0) before
         short circuit (depends on network configuration and relevant
         reliability philosophy). It is used for calculation of the
         impedance correction factor KT defined in IEC 60909-0.
         Default: 0.0

      beforeShCircuitHighestOperatingVoltage:
         The highest operating voltage (Ub in the IEC 60909-0) before
         short circuit. It is used for calculation of the impedance
         correction factor KT defined in IEC 60909-0. This is worst
         case voltage on the low side winding (Section 3.7.1 in the
         standard). Used to define operating conditions. Default: 0.0

      beforeShortCircuitAnglePf:
         The angle of power factor before short circuit (phib in the
         IEC 60909-0). It is used for calculation of the impedance
         correction factor KT defined in IEC 60909-0. This is the
         worst case power factor. Used to define operating conditions.
         Default: 0.0

      highSideMinOperatingU:
         The minimum operating voltage (uQmin in the IEC 60909-0) at
         the high voltage side (Q side) of the unit transformer of the
         power station unit. A value well established from long-term
         operating experience of the system. It is used for
         calculation of the impedance correction factor KG defined in
         IEC 60909-0 Default: 0.0

      isPartOfGeneratorUnit:
         Indicates whether the machine is part of a power station
         unit. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC
         60909 Default: False

      operationalValuesConsidered:
         It is used to define if the data (other attributes related to
         short circuit data exchange) defines long term operational
         conditions or not. Used for short circuit data exchange
         according to IEC 60909. Default: False

   Documentation of parent class ConductingEquipment:

      The parts of the AC power system that are designed to carry
      current or that are conductively connected through terminals.

      BaseVoltage:
         All conducting equipment with this base voltage.  Use only
         when there is no voltage level container used and only one
         base voltage applies.  For example, not used for
         transformers. Default: None

      Terminals:
         Conducting equipment have terminals that may be connected to
         other conducting equipment terminals via connectivity nodes
         or topological nodes. Default: "list"

      SvStatus:
         The status state variable associated with this conducting
         equipment. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class Equipment:

      The parts of a power system that are physical devices,
      electronic or mechanical.

      aggregate:
         The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces
         of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.
         Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines
         operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power
         transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to
         be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of
         interdependent equipment produced by a network production
         program. Default: False

      EquipmentContainer:
         Container of this equipment. Default: None

      OperationalLimitSet:
         The operational limit sets associated with this equipment.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
