class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TurbLCFB1.TurbLCFB1(mwbase=0.0, speedReferenceGovernor=False, db=0.0, emax=0.0, fb=0.0, kp=0.0, ki=0.0, fbf=False, pbf=False, tpelec=0, irmax=0.0, pmwset=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      Turbine Load Controller model developed in the WECC.  This model
      represents a supervisory turbine load controller that acts to
      maintain turbine power at a set value by continuous adjustment
      of the turbine governor speed-load reference. This model is
      intended to represent slow reset 'outer loop' controllers
      managing the action of the turbine governor.

      mwbase:
         Base for power values (MWbase) (>0).  Unit = MW. Default: 0.0

      speedReferenceGovernor:
         Type of turbine governor reference (Type). true = speed
         reference governor false = load reference governor. Typical
         Value = true. Default: False

      db:
         Controller dead band (db).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      emax:
         Maximum control error (Emax) (note 4).  Typical Value = 0.02.
         Default: 0.0

      fb:
         Frequency bias gain (Fb).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      kp:
         Proportional gain (Kp).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      ki:
         Integral gain (Ki).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      fbf:
         Frequency bias flag (Fbf). true = enable frequency bias false
         = disable frequency bias. Typical Value = false. Default:
         False

      pbf:
         Power controller flag (Pbf). true = enable load controller
         false = disable load controller. Typical Value = false.
         Default: False

      tpelec:
         Power transducer time constant (Tpelec).  Typical Value = 0.
         Default: 0

      irmax:
         Maximum turbine speed/load reference bias (Irmax) (note 3).
         Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      pmwset:
         Power controller setpoint (Pmwset) (note 1).  Unit = MW.
         Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class TurbineLoadControllerDynamics:

      Turbine load controller function block whose behavior is
      described by reference to a standard model

      TurbineGovernorDynamics:
         Turbine-governor controlled by this turbine load controller.
         Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
