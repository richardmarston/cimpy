********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.VsCapabilityCurve.VsCapabilityCurve(VsConverterDCSides='list', *args, **kw_args)

      The P-Q capability curve for a voltage source converter, with P
      on x-axis and Qmin and Qmax on y1-axis and y2-axis.

      VsConverterDCSides:
         Capability curve of this converter. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class Curve:

      A multi-purpose curve or functional relationship between an
      independent variable (X-axis) and dependent (Y-axis) variables.

      curveStyle:
         The style or shape of the curve. Default: None

      xUnit:
         The X-axis units of measure. Default: None

      y1Unit:
         The Y1-axis units of measure. Default: None

      y2Unit:
         The Y2-axis units of measure. Default: None

      CurveDatas:
         The curve of  this curve data point. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
