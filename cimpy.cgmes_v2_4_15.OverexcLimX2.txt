class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.OverexcLimX2.OverexcLimX2(m=False, efdrated=0.0, efd1=0.0, t1=0, efd2=0.0, t2=0, efd3=0.0, t3=0, efddes=0.0, kmx=0.0, vlow=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      Field Voltage or Current overexcitation limiter designed to
      protect the generator field of an AC machine with automatic
      excitation control from overheating due to prolonged
      overexcitation.

      m:
         (m). true = IFD limiting false = EFD limiting. Default: False

      efdrated:
         Rated field voltage if m=F or field current if m=T (EFD).
         Typical Value = 1.05. Default: 0.0

      efd1:
         Low voltage or current point on the inverse time
         characteristic (EFD).  Typical Value = 1.1. Default: 0.0

      t1:
         Time to trip the exciter at the low voltage or current point
         on the inverse time characteristic (TIME).  Typical Value =
         120. Default: 0

      efd2:
         Mid voltage or current point on the inverse time
         characteristic (EFD).  Typical Value = 1.2. Default: 0.0

      t2:
         Time to trip the exciter at the mid voltage or current point
         on the inverse time characteristic (TIME).  Typical Value =
         40. Default: 0

      efd3:
         High voltage or current point on the inverse time
         characteristic (EFD).  Typical Value = 1.5. Default: 0.0

      t3:
         Time to trip the exciter at the high voltage or current point
         on the inverse time characteristic (TIME).  Typical Value =
         15. Default: 0

      efddes:
         Desired field voltage if m=F or field current if m=T (EFD).
         Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0

      kmx:
         Gain (K).  Typical Value = 0.002. Default: 0.0

      vlow:
         Low voltage limit (V) (>0). Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class OverexcitationLimiterDynamics:

      Overexcitation limiter function block whose behaviour is
      described by reference to a standard model

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this overexcitation
         limiter model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
