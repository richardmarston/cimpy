class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEST1A.ExcIEEEST1A(ilr=0.0, ka=0.0, kc=0.0, kf=0.0, klr=0.0, pssin=False, ta=0, tb=0, tb1=0, tc=0, tc1=0, tf=0, uelin=None, vamax=0.0, vamin=0.0, vimax=0.0, vimin=0.0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type ST1A model. This
      model represents systems in which excitation power is supplied
      through a transformer from the generator terminals (or the
      unit's auxiliary bus) and is regulated by a controlled
      rectifier.  The maximum exciter voltage available from such
      systems is directly related to the generator terminal voltage.
      Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 7.1.

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:

         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
