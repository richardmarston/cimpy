   Documentation of parent class AsynchronousMachineDynamics:

      Asynchronous machine whose behaviour is described by reference
      to a standard model expressed in either time constant reactance
      form or equivalent circuit form

      AsynchronousMachine:
         Asynchronous machine to which this asynchronous machine
         dynamics model applies. Default: None

      MechanicalLoadDynamics:
         Mechanical load model associated with this asynchronous
         machine model. Default: None

      WindTurbineType1or2Dynamics:
         Wind generator type 1 or 2 model associated with this
         asynchronous machine model. Default: None

      TurbineGovernorDynamics:
         Turbine-governor model associated with this asynchronous
         machine model. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class RotatingMachineDynamics:

      Abstract parent class for all synchronous and asynchronous
      machine standard models.

      damping:
         Damping torque coefficient (D).  A proportionality constant
         that, when multiplied by the angular velocity of the rotor
         poles with respect to the magnetic field (frequency), results
         in the damping torque.  This value is often zero when the
         sources of damping torques (generator damper windings, load
         damping effects, etc.) are modelled in detail.  Typical Value
         = 0. Default: 0.0

      inertia:
         Inertia constant of generator or motor and mechanical load
         (H) (>0).  This is the specification for the stored energy in
         the rotating mass when operating at rated speed.  For a
         generator, this includes the generator plus all other
         elements (turbine, exciter) on the same shaft and has units
         of MW*sec.  For a motor, it includes the motor plus its
         mechanical load. Conventional units are per unit on the
         generator MVA base, usually expressed as MW*second/MVA or
         just second.   This value is used in the accelerating power
         reference frame for operator training simulator solutions.
         Typical Value = 3. Default: 0

      saturationFactor:
         Saturation factor at rated terminal voltage (S1) (> or =0).
         Not used by simplified model.  Defined by defined by S(E1) in
         the SynchronousMachineSaturationParameters diagram.  Typical
         Value = 0.02. Default: 0.0

      saturationFactor120:
         Saturation factor at 120% of rated terminal voltage (S12) (>
         or =S1). Not used by the simplified model, defined by S(E2)
         in the SynchronousMachineSaturationParameters diagram.
         Typical Value = 0.12. Default: 0.0

      statorLeakageReactance:
         Stator leakage reactance (Xl) (> or =0). Typical Value =
         0.15. Default: 0.0

      statorResistance:
         Stator (armature) resistance (Rs) (> or =0). Typical Value =
         0.005. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
