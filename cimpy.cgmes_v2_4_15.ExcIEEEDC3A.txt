class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEDC3A.ExcIEEEDC3A(trh=0, kv=0.0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, te=0, ke=0.0, efd1=0.0, seefd1=0.0, efd2=0.0, seefd2=0.0, exclim=False, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type DC3A model. This
      model represents represent older systems, in particular those dc
      commutator exciters with non-continuously acting regulators that
      were commonly used before the development of the continuously
      acting varieties.  These systems respond at basically two
      different rates, depending upon the magnitude of voltage error.
      For small errors, adjustment is made periodically with a signal
      to a motor-operated rheostat. Larger errors cause resistors to
      be quickly shorted or inserted and a strong forcing signal
      applied to the exciter. Continuous motion of the motor-operated
      rheostat occurs for these larger error signals, even though it
      is bypassed by contactor action.   Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 5.3.

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
