cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.SvInjection module
**************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.SvInjection.SvInjection(pInjection=0.0, qInjection=0.0, TopologicalNode=None)

   The SvInjection is reporting the calculated bus injection minus the
   sum of the terminal flows. The terminal flow is positive out from
   the bus (load sign convention) and bus injection has positive flow
   into the bus. SvInjection may have the remainder after state
   estimation or slack after power flow calculation.

   PInjection:
      The active power injected into the bus in addition to injections
      from equipment terminals.  Positive sign means injection into
      the TopologicalNode (bus). Default: 0.0

   QInjection:
      The reactive power injected into the bus in addition to
      injections from equipment terminals. Positive sign means
      injection into the TopologicalNode (bus). Default: 0.0

   TopologicalNode:
      The injection flows state variables associated with the
      topological node. Default: None
