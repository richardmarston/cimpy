class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.OperationalLimitType.OperationalLimitType(OperationalLimit='list', acceptableDuration=0, limitType=None, direction=None, *args, **kw_args)

      The operational meaning of a category of limits.

      OperationalLimit:
         The operational limits associated with this type of limit.
         Default: "list"

      acceptableDuration:
         The nominal acceptable duration of the limit.  Limits are
         commonly expressed in terms of the a time limit for which the
         limit is normally acceptable.   The actual acceptable
         duration of a specific limit may depend on other local
         factors such as temperature or wind speed. Default: 0

      limitType:
         Types of limits defined in the ENTSO-E Operational Handbook
         Policy 3. Default: None

      direction:
         The direction of the limit. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
