cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TransformerEnd module
*****************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TransformerEnd.TransformerEnd(BaseVoltage=None, Terminal=None, PhaseTapChanger=None, RatioTapChanger=None, endNumber=0, rground=0.0, grounded=False, xground=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      A conducting connection point of a power transformer. It
      corresponds to a physical transformer winding terminal.  In
      earlier CIM versions, the TransformerWinding class served a
      similar purpose, but this class is more flexible because it
      associates to terminal but is not a specialization of
      ConductingEquipment.

      BaseVoltage:
         Base voltage of the transformer end.  This is essential for
         PU calculation. Default: None

      Terminal:
         Terminal of the power transformer to which this transformer
         end belongs. Default: None

      PhaseTapChanger:
         Transformer end to which this phase tap changer belongs.
         Default: None

      RatioTapChanger:
         Transformer end to which this ratio tap changer belongs.
         Default: None

      endNumber:
         Number for this transformer end, corresponding to the end`s
         order in the power transformer vector group or phase angle
         clock number.  Highest voltage winding should be 1.  Each end
         within a power transformer should have a unique subsequent
         end number.   Note the transformer end number need not match
         the terminal sequence number. Default: 0

      rground:
         (for Yn and Zn connections) Resistance part of neutral
         impedance where *grounded* is true. Default: 0.0

      grounded:
         (for Yn and Zn connections) True if the neutral is solidly
         grounded. Default: False

      xground:
         (for Yn and Zn connections) Reactive part of neutral
         impedance where *grounded* is true. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
