      General model for any prime mover with a PID governor, used
      primarily for combustion turbine and combined cycle units. This
      model can be used to represent a variety of prime movers
      controlled by PID governors.  It is suitable, for example, for
      representation of     Additional information on this model is
      available in the 2012 IEEE report, , section 3.1.2.3 page 3-4
      (GGOV1).

      wfspd:
         Switch for fuel source characteristic to recognize that fuel
         flow, for a given fuel valve stroke, can be proportional to
         engine speed (Wfspd). true = fuel flow proportional to speed
         (for some gas turbines and diesel engines with positive
         displacement fuel injectors) false = fuel control system
         keeps fuel flow independent of engine speed. Typical Value =
         true. Default: False

      teng:
         Transport time delay for diesel engine used in representing
         diesel engines where there is a small but measurable
         transport delay between a change in fuel flow setting and the
         development of torque (Teng).  Teng should be zero in all but

      dm:
         Speed sensitivity coefficient (Dm).  Dm can represent either
         the variation of the engine power with the shaft speed or the
         variation of maximum power capability with shaft speed.  If
         it is positive it describes the falling slope of the engine
         speed verses power characteristic as speed increases. A
         slightly falling characteristic is typical for reciprocating
         engines and some aero-derivative turbines.  If it is negative
         the engine power is assumed to be unaffected by the shaft
         speed, but the maximum permissible fuel flow is taken to fall
         with falling shaft speed. This is characteristic of single-
         shaft industrial turbines due to exhaust temperature limits.

         Value = -0.1. Default: 0.0

      kimw:
         Power controller (reset) gain (Kimw).  The default value of
         0.01 corresponds to a reset time of 100 seconds.  A value of
         0.001 corresponds to a relatively slow acting load
         controller.  Typical Value = 0.01. Default: 0.0

      aset:
         Acceleration limiter setpoint (Aset).  Unit = PU/sec.
         Typical Value = 0.01. Default: 0.0

         = 0.1. Default: 0

      db:
         Speed governor dead band in per unit speed (db).  In the
         majority of applications, it is recommended that this value
         be set to zero.  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The

         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
