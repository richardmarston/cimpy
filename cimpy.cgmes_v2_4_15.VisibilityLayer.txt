class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.VisibilityLayer.VisibilityLayer(VisibleObjects='list', drawingOrder=0, *args, **kw_args)

      Layers are typically used for grouping diagram objects according
      to themes and scales. Themes are used to display or hide certain
      information (e.g., lakes, borders), while scales are used for
      hiding or displaying information depending on the current zoom
      level (hide text when it is too small to be read, or when it
      exceeds the screen size). This is also called de-cluttering.
      CIM based graphics exchange will support an m:n relationship
      between diagram objects and layers. It will be the task of the
      importing system to convert an m:n case into an appropriate 1:n
      representation if the importing system does not support m:n.

      VisibleObjects:
         A visibility layer can contain one or more diagram objects.
         Default: "list"

      drawingOrder:
         The drawing order for this layer.  The higher the number, the
         later the layer and the objects within it are rendered.
         Default: 0

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
