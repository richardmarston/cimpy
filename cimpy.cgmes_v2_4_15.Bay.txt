cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.Bay module
******************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.Bay.Bay(VoltageLevel=None, *args, **kw_args)

      A collection of power system resources (within a given
      substation) including conducting equipment, protection relays,
      measurements, and telemetry.  A bay typically represents a
      physical grouping related to modularization of equipment.

      VoltageLevel:
         The voltage level containing this bay. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class EquipmentContainer:

      A modeling construct to provide a root class for containing
      equipment.

      Equipments:
         Contained equipment. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class ConnectivityNodeContainer:

      A base class for all objects that may contain connectivity nodes
      or topological nodes.

      ConnectivityNodes:
         Connectivity nodes which belong to this connectivity node
         container. Default: "list"

      TopologicalNode:
         The topological nodes which belong to this connectivity node
         container. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.
         Default: "list"

      Location:
         Location of this power system resource. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
