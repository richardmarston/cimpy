cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.DCLine module
*********************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.DCLine.DCLine(Region=None, *args, **kw_args)

      Overhead lines and/or cables connecting two or more HVDC
      substations.

      Region:
         Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DCEquipmentContainer:

      A modeling construct to provide a root class for containment of
      DC as well as AC equipment. The class differ from the
      EquipmentContaner for AC in that it may also contain DCNodes.
      Hence it can contain both AC and DC equipment.

      DCNodes:
         Default: "list"

      DCTopologicalNode:
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class EquipmentContainer:

      A modeling construct to provide a root class for containing
      equipment.

      Equipments:
         Contained equipment. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class ConnectivityNodeContainer:

      A base class for all objects that may contain connectivity nodes
      or topological nodes.

      ConnectivityNodes:
         Connectivity nodes which belong to this connectivity node
         container. Default: "list"

      TopologicalNode:
         The topological nodes which belong to this connectivity node
         container. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.
         Default: "list"

      Location:
         Location of this power system resource. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
