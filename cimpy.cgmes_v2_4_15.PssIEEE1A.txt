class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PssIEEE1A.PssIEEE1A(inputSignalType=None, a1=0.0, a2=0.0, t1=0, t2=0, t3=0, t4=0, t5=0, t6=0, ks=0.0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type PSS1A power system
      stabilizer model. PSS1A is the generalized form of a PSS with a
      single input. Some common stabilizer input signals are speed,
      frequency, and power.  Reference: IEEE 1A 421.5-2005 Section
      8.1.

      inputSignalType:
         Type of input signal.  Typical Value =
         rotorAngularFrequencyDeviation. Default: None

      a1:
         PSS signal conditioning frequency filter constant (A1).
         Typical Value = 0.061. Default: 0.0

      a2:
         PSS signal conditioning frequency filter constant (A2).
         Typical Value = 0.0017. Default: 0.0

      t1:
         Lead/lag time constant (T1).  Typical Value = 0.3. Default: 0

      t2:
         Lead/lag time constant (T2).  Typical Value = 0.03. Default:
         0

      t3:
         Lead/lag time constant (T3).  Typical Value = 0.3. Default: 0

      t4:
         Lead/lag time constant (T4).  Typical Value = 0.03. Default:
         0

      t5:
         Washout time constant (T5).  Typical Value = 10. Default: 0

      t6:
         Transducer time constant (T6).  Typical Value = 0.01.
         Default: 0

      ks:
         Stabilizer gain (Ks).  Typical Value = 5. Default: 0.0

      vrmax:
         Maximum stabilizer output (Vrmax).  Typical Value = 0.05.
         Default: 0.0

      vrmin:
         Minimum stabilizer output (Vrmin).  Typical Value = -0.05.
         Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemStabilizerDynamics:

      Power system stabilizer function block whose behaviour is
      described by reference to a standard model

      RemoteInputSignal:
         Remote input signal used by this power system stabilizer
         model. Default: "list"

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this power system
         stabilizer model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
