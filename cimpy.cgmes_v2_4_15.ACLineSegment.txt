class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ACLineSegment.ACLineSegment(bch=0.0, gch=0.0, r=0.0, x=0.0, b0ch=0.0, g0ch=0.0, r0=0.0, shortCircuitEndTemperature=0.0, x0=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      A wire or combination of wires, with consistent electrical
      characteristics, building a single electrical system, used to
      carry alternating current between points in the power system.
      For symmetrical, transposed 3ph lines, it is sufficient to use
      attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and
      admittances for the entire length of the segment.  Additionally
      impedances can be computed by using length and associated per
      length impedances. The BaseVoltage at the two ends of
      ACLineSegments in a Line shall have the same
      BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines  may have
      slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and  variation is
      allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an
      equivalent branch.

         Zero sequence series reactance of the entire line section.
         Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class Conductor:

      Combination of conducting material with consistent electrical
      characteristics, building a single electrical system, used to
      carry current between points in the power system.

      length:
         Segment length for calculating line section capabilities
         Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class ConductingEquipment:

      The parts of the AC power system that are designed to carry
      current or that are conductively connected through terminals.

      BaseVoltage:
         All conducting equipment with this base voltage.  Use only
         when there is no voltage level container used and only one
         base voltage applies.  For example, not used for
         transformers. Default: None

      Terminals:
         Conducting equipment have terminals that may be connected to
         other conducting equipment terminals via connectivity nodes
         or topological nodes. Default: "list"

      SvStatus:
         The status state variable associated with this conducting
         equipment. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class Equipment:

      The parts of a power system that are physical devices,
      electronic or mechanical.

      aggregate:
         The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces
         of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.
         Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines
         operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power
         transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to
         be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of
         interdependent equipment produced by a network production
         program. Default: False

      EquipmentContainer:
         Container of this equipment. Default: None

      OperationalLimitSet:
         The operational limit sets associated with this equipment.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
