******************************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PFVArType1IEEEVArController.PFVArType1IEEEVArController(tvarc=0, vvar=0.0, vvarcbw=0.0, vvarref=0.0, vvtmax=0.0, vvtmin=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE VAR Controller Type 1 which operates
      by moving the voltage reference directly.  Reference: IEEE
      Standard 421.5-2005 Section 11.3.

      tvarc:
         Var controller time delay ().  Typical Value = 5. Default: 0

      vvar:
         Synchronous machine power factor (). Default: 0.0

      vvarcbw:
         Var controller dead band ().  Typical Value = 0.02. Default:
         0.0

      vvarref:
         Var controller reference (). Default: 0.0

      vvtmax:
         Maximum machine terminal voltage needed for pf/var controller
         to be enabled (). Default: 0.0

      vvtmin:
         Minimum machine terminal voltage needed to enable pf/var
         controller (). Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class PFVArControllerType1Dynamics:

      Power Factor or VAr controller Type I function block whose
      behaviour is described by reference to a standard model

      RemoteInputSignal:
         Remote input signal used by this Power Factor or VAr
         controller Type I model. Default: None

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this Power Factor or VAr
         controller Type I model is associated. Default: None

      VoltageAdjusterDynamics:
         Voltage adjuster model associated with this Power Factor or
         VA controller Type I model. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
