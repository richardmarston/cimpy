class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEST3A.ExcIEEEST3A(vimax=0.0, vimin=0.0, ka=0.0, ta=0, tb=0, tc=0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, km=0.0, tm=0, vmmax=0.0, vmmin=0.0, kg=0.0, kp=0.0, thetap=0.0, ki=0.0, kc=0.0, xl=0.0, vbmax=0.0, vgmax=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type ST3A model.  Some
      static systems utilize a field voltage control loop to linearize
      the exciter control characteristic. This also makes the output
      independent of supply source variations until supply limitations
      are reached.  These systems utilize a variety of controlled-
      rectifier designs: full thyristor complements or hybrid bridges
      in either series or shunt configurations. The power source may
      consist of only a potential source, either fed from the machine
      terminals or from internal windings. Some designs may have
      compound power sources utilizing both machine potential and
      current. These power sources are represented as phasor
      combinations of machine terminal current and voltage and are
      accommodated by suitable parameters in model Type ST3A which is
      represented by ExcIEEEST3A.   Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 7.3.

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global

         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
