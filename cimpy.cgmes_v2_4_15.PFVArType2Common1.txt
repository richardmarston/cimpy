class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PFVArType2Common1.PFVArType2Common1(j=False, kp=0.0, ki=0.0, max=0.0, ref=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      Power factor / Reactive power regulator. This model represents
      the power factor or reactive power controller such as the Basler
      SCP-250. The controller measures power factor or reactive power
      (PU on generator rated power) and compares it with the
      operator's set point.

      j:
         Selector (J). true = control mode for reactive power false =
         control mode for power factor. Default: False

      kp:
         Proportional gain (Kp). Default: 0.0

      ki:
         Reset gain (Ki). Default: 0.0

      max:
         Output limit (max). Default: 0.0

      ref:
         Reference value of reactive power or power factor (Ref). The
         reference value is initialised by this model. This
         initialisation may override the value exchanged by this
         attribute to represent a plant operator`s change of the
         reference setting. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class PFVArControllerType2Dynamics:

      Power Factor or VAr controller Type II function block whose
      behaviour is described by reference to a standard model

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this Power Factor or VAr
         controller Type II is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
