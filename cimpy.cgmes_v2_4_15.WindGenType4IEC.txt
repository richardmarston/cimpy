class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.WindGenType4IEC.WindGenType4IEC(dipmax=0.0, diqmin=0.0, diqmax=0.0, tg=0, *args, **kw_args)

      IEC Type 4 generator set model.  Reference: IEC Standard
      61400-27-1 Section 6.6.3.4.

      dipmax:
         Maximum active current ramp rate (di). It is project
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      diqmin:
         Minimum reactive current ramp rate (d). It is case dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      diqmax:
         Maximum reactive current ramp rate (di). It is project
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      tg:
         Time constant (T). It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0

   Documentation of parent class WindTurbineType3or4IEC:

      Parent class supporting relationships to IEC wind turbines Type
      3 and 4 and wind plant including their control models.

      WindContCurrLimIEC:
         Wind control current limitation model associated with this
         wind turbine type 3 or 4 model. Default: None

      WIndContQIEC:
         Wind control Q model associated with this wind turbine type 3
         or 4 model. Default: None

      WindProtectionIEC:
         Wind turbune protection model associated with this wind
         generator type 3 or 4 model. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class WindTurbineType3or4Dynamics:

      Parent class supporting relationships to wind turbines Type 3
      and 4 and wind plant including their control models.

      EnergySource:
         Energy Source (current source) with which this wind Type 3 or
         4 dynamics model is asoociated. Default: None

      RemoteInputSignal:
         Wind turbine Type 3 or 4 models using this remote input
         signal. Default: None

      WindPlantDynamics:
         The wind plant with which the wind turbines type 3 or 4 are
         associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
