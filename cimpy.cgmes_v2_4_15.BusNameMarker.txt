cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.BusNameMarker module
****************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.BusNameMarker.BusNameMarker(priority=0, ReportingGroup=None, Terminal='list', *args, **kw_args)

      Used to apply user standard names to topology buses. Typically
      used for "bus/branch" case generation. Associated with one or
      more terminals that are normally connected with the bus name.
      The associated terminals are normally connected by non-retained
      switches. For a ring bus station configuration, all busbar
      terminals in the ring are typically associated.   For a breaker
      and a half scheme, both busbars would normally be associated.
      For a ring bus, all busbars would normally be associated.  For a
      "straight" busbar configuration, normally only the main terminal
      at the busbar would be associated.

      priority:
         Priority of bus name marker for use as topology bus name.
         Use 0 for don t care.  Use 1 for highest priority.  Use 2 as
         priority is less than 1 and so on. Default: 0

      ReportingGroup:
         The bus name markers that belong to this reporting group.
         Default: None

      Terminal:
         The terminals associated with this bus name marker. Default:
         "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
