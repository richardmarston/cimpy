Export Example Documentation
****************************

This guide demonstrates the basic usage of the function cim_export.
The whole script can be found in gitlab.

For this export example we use the result from the import example. The
whole explanation of the import procedure can be found in the import
documentation.

   import_result = cimpy.cim_import(xml_files, "cgmes_v2_4_15")

For the function cim_export a list containing all profiles which
should be used for the export is needed. For more information about
the arguments of the cim_export function see Functions.

   activeProfileList = ['DI', 'EQ', 'SV', 'TP']

In the next step the objects stored in import_result are exported to
XML/RDF files.

   cimpy.cim_export(import_result, 'CIGREMV_reference_cgmes_v2_4_15', 'cgmes_v2_4_15', activeProfileList)

The XML/RDF files are generated inside the folder from which the
function was called.
