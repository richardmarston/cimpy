class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEAC5A.ExcIEEEAC5A(ka=0.0, ta=0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, ke=0.0, te=0, kf=0.0, tf1=0, tf2=0, tf3=0, efd1=0.0, seefd1=0.0, efd2=0.0, seefd2=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC5A model. The
      model represents a simplified model for brushless excitation
      systems. The regulator is supplied from a source, such as a
      permanent magnet generator, which is not affected by system
      disturbances.  Unlike other ac models, this model uses loaded
      rather than open circuit exciter saturation data in the same way
      as it is used for the dc models.  Because the model has been
      widely implemented by the industry, it is sometimes used to
      represent other types of systems when either detailed data for
      them are not available or simplified models are required.
      Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 6.5.

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
