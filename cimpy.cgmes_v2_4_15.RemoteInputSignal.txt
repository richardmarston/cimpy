class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.RemoteInputSignal.RemoteInputSignal(Terminal=None, remoteSignalType=None, PFVArControllerType1Dynamics=None, UnderexcitationLimiterDynamics=None, WindTurbineType1or2Dynamics=None, VoltageCompensatorDynamics=None, PowerSystemStabilizerDynamics=None, DiscontinuousExcitationControlDynamics=None, WindTurbineType3or4Dynamics=None, WindPlantDynamics=None, *args, **kw_args)

      Supports connection to a terminal associated with a remote bus
      from which an input signal of a specific type is coming.

      Terminal:
         Remote terminal with which this input signal is associated.
         Default: None

      remoteSignalType:
         Type of input signal. Default: None

      PFVArControllerType1Dynamics:
         Power Factor or VAr controller Type I model using this remote
         input signal. Default: None

      UnderexcitationLimiterDynamics:
         Underexcitation limiter model using this remote input signal.
         Default: None

      WindTurbineType1or2Dynamics:
         Wind generator Type 1 or Type 2 model using this remote input
         signal. Default: None

      VoltageCompensatorDynamics:
         Voltage compensator model using this remote input signal.
         Default: None

      PowerSystemStabilizerDynamics:
         Power system stabilizer model using this remote input signal.
         Default: None

      DiscontinuousExcitationControlDynamics:
         Discontinuous excitation control model using this remote
         input signal. Default: None

      WindTurbineType3or4Dynamics:
         Remote input signal used by these wind turbine Type 3 or 4
         models. Default: None

      WindPlantDynamics:
         The remote signal with which this power plant is associated.
         Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
