cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TieFlow module
**********************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TieFlow.TieFlow(Terminal=None, ControlArea=None, positiveFlowIn=False)

   A flow specification in terms of location and direction for a
   control area.

   Terminal:
      The terminal to which this tie flow belongs. Default: None

   ControlArea:
      The control area of the tie flows. Default: None

   PositiveFlowIn:
      True if the flow into the terminal (load convention) is also
      flow into the control area.  For example, this attribute should
      be true if using the tie line terminal further away from the
      control area. For example to represent a tie to a shunt
      component (like a load or generator) in another area, this is
      the near end of a branch and this attribute would be specified
      as false. Default: False
