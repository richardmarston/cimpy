****************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ValueAliasSet.ValueAliasSet(Commands='list', Discretes='list', RaiseLowerCommands='list', Values='list', *args, **kw_args)

      Describes the translation of a set of values into a name and is
      intendend to facilitate cusom translations. Each ValueAliasSet
      has a name, description etc. A specific Measurement may
      represent a discrete state like Open, Closed, Intermediate etc.
      This requires a translation from the MeasurementValue.value
      number to a string, e.g. 0->"Invalid", 1->"Open", 2->"Closed",
      3->"Intermediate". Each ValueToAlias member in
      ValueAliasSet.Value describe a mapping for one particular value
      to a name.

      Commands:
         The Commands using the set for translation. Default: "list"

      Discretes:
         The Measurements using the set for translation. Default:
         "list"

      RaiseLowerCommands:
         The Commands using the set for translation. Default: "list"

      Values:
         The ValueAliasSet having the ValueToAlias mappings. Default:
         "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
