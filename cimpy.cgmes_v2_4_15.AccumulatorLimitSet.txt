**********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.AccumulatorLimitSet.AccumulatorLimitSet(Measurements='list', Limits='list', *args, **kw_args)

      An AccumulatorLimitSet specifies a set of Limits that are
      associated with an Accumulator measurement.

      Measurements:
         A measurement may have zero or more limit ranges defined for
         it. Default: "list"

      Limits:
         The set of limits. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class LimitSet:

      Specifies a set of Limits that are associated with a
      Measurement. A Measurement may have several LimitSets
      corresponding to seasonal or other changing conditions. The
      condition is captured in the name and description attributes.
      The same LimitSet may be used for several Measurements. In
      particular percentage limits are used this way.

      isPercentageLimits:
         Tells if the limit values are in percentage of normalValue or
         the specified Unit for Measurements and Controls. Default:
         False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
