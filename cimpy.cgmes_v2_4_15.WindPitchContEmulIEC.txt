      Pitch control emulator model.  Reference: IEC Standard
      61400-27-1 Section 6.6.5.1.

      WindGenTurbineType2IEC:
         Wind turbine type 2 model with which this Pitch control
         emulator model is associated. Default: None

      kdroop:
         Power error gain (). It is case dependent parameter. Default:
         0.0

      kipce:
         Pitch control emulator integral constant (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      komegaaero:
         Aerodynamic power change vs. omegachange (). It is case
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      kppce:
         Pitch control emulator proportional constant (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      omegaref:
         Rotor speed in initial steady state (omega). It is case
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      pimax:
         Maximum steady state power (). It is case dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      pimin:
         Minimum steady state power (). It is case dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      t1:
         First time constant in pitch control lag (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

      t2:
         Second time constant in pitch control lag (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

      tpe:
         Time constant in generator air gap power lag (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
