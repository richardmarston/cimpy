class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEST2A.ExcIEEEST2A(ka=0.0, ta=0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, ke=0.0, te=0, kf=0.0, tf=0, kp=0.0, ki=0.0, kc=0.0, efdmax=0.0, uelin=False, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type ST2A model. Some
      static systems utilize both current and voltage sources
      (generator terminal quantities) to comprise the power source.
      The regulator controls the exciter output through controlled
      saturation of the power transformer components.  These compound-
      source rectifier excitation systems are designated Type ST2A and
      are represented by ExcIEEEST2A.  Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 7.2.

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
