cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.LoadResponseCharacteristic module
*****************************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.LoadResponseCharacteristic.LoadResponseCharacteristic(EnergyConsumer='list', exponentModel=False, pConstantCurrent=0.0, pConstantImpedance=0.0, pConstantPower=0.0, pFrequencyExponent=0.0, pVoltageExponent=0.0, qConstantCurrent=0.0, qConstantImpedance=0.0, qConstantPower=0.0, qFrequencyExponent=0.0, qVoltageExponent=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      Models the characteristic response of the load demand due to
      changes in system conditions such as voltage and frequency. This
      is not related to demand response.  If
      LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is True, the voltage
      exponents are specified and used as to calculate:  Active power
      component = Pnominal * (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)
      ** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent  Reactive
      power component = Qnominal *
      (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)**
      cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent  Where  * means
      "multiply" and ** is "raised to power of".

      EnergyConsumer:
         The set of loads that have the response characteristics.
         Default: "list"

      exponentModel:
         Indicates the exponential voltage dependency model is to be
         used.   If false, the coefficient model is to be used. The
         exponential voltage dependency model consist of the
         attributes - pVoltageExponent - qVoltageExponent. The
         coefficient model consist of the attributes -
         pConstantImpedance - pConstantCurrent - pConstantPower -
         qConstantImpedance - qConstantCurrent - qConstantPower. The
         sum of pConstantImpedance, pConstantCurrent and
         pConstantPower shall equal 1. The sum of qConstantImpedance,
         qConstantCurrent and qConstantPower shall equal 1. Default:
         False

      pConstantCurrent:
         Portion of active power load modeled as constant current.
         Default: 0.0

      pConstantImpedance:
         Portion of active power load modeled as constant impedance.
         Default: 0.0

      pConstantPower:
         Portion of active power load modeled as constant power.
         Default: 0.0

      pFrequencyExponent:
         Exponent of per unit frequency effecting active power.
         Default: 0.0

      pVoltageExponent:
         Exponent of per unit voltage effecting real power. Default:
         0.0

      qConstantCurrent:
         Portion of reactive power load modeled as constant current.
         Default: 0.0

      qConstantImpedance:
         Portion of reactive power load modeled as constant impedance.
         Default: 0.0

      qConstantPower:
         Portion of reactive power load modeled as constant power.
         Default: 0.0

      qFrequencyExponent:
         Exponent of per unit frequency effecting reactive power.
         Default: 0.0

      qVoltageExponent:
         Exponent of per unit voltage effecting reactive power.
         Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
