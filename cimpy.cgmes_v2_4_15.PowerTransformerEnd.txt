class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PowerTransformerEnd.PowerTransformerEnd(PowerTransformer=None, b=0.0, connectionKind=None, ratedS=0.0, g=0.0, ratedU=0.0, r=0.0, x=0.0, b0=0.0, phaseAngleClock=0, g0=0.0, r0=0.0, x0=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      A PowerTransformerEnd is associated with each Terminal of a
      PowerTransformer. The impedance values r, r0, x, and x0 of a
      PowerTransformerEnd represents a star equivalent as follows 1)
      for a two Terminal PowerTransformer the high voltage
      PowerTransformerEnd has non zero values on r, r0, x, and x0
      while the low voltage PowerTransformerEnd has zero values for r,
      r0, x, and x0. 2) for a three Terminal PowerTransformer the
      three PowerTransformerEnds represents a star equivalent with
      each leg in the star represented by r, r0, x, and x0 values. 3)
      for a PowerTransformer with more than three Terminals the
      PowerTransformerEnd impedance values cannot be used. Instead use
      the TransformerMeshImpedance or split the transformer into
      multiple PowerTransformers.

      PowerTransformer:
         The ends of this power transformer. Default: None

      b:
         Magnetizing branch susceptance (B mag).  The value can be
         positive or negative. Default: 0.0

      connectionKind:
         Kind of connection. Default: None

      ratedS:
         Normal apparent power rating. The attribute shall be a
         positive value. For a two-winding transformer the values for
         the high and low voltage sides shall be identical. Default:
         0.0

      g:
         Magnetizing branch conductance. Default: 0.0

      ratedU:
         Rated voltage: phase-phase for three-phase windings, and
         either phase-phase or phase-neutral for single-phase
         windings. A high voltage side, as given by
         TransformerEnd.endNumber, shall have a ratedU that is greater
         or equal than ratedU for the lower voltage sides. Default:
         0.0

      r:
         Resistance (star-model) of the transformer end. The attribute
         shall be equal or greater than zero for non-equivalent
         transformers. Default: 0.0

      x:
         Positive sequence series reactance (star-model) of the
         transformer end. Default: 0.0

      b0:
         Zero sequence magnetizing branch susceptance. Default: 0.0

      phaseAngleClock:
         Terminal voltage phase angle displacement where 360 degrees
         are represented with clock hours. The valid values are 0 to
         11. For example, for the secondary side end of a transformer
         with vector group code of *Dyn11*, specify the connection
         kind as wye with neutral and specify the phase angle of the
         clock as 11.  The clock value of the transformer end number
         specified as 1, is assumed to be zero.  Note the transformer
         end number is not assumed to be the same as the terminal
         sequence number. Default: 0

      g0:
         Zero sequence magnetizing branch conductance (star-model).
         Default: 0.0

      r0:
         Zero sequence series resistance (star-model) of the
         transformer end. Default: 0.0

      x0:
         Zero sequence series reactance of the transformer end.
         Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class TransformerEnd:

      A conducting connection point of a power transformer. It
      corresponds to a physical transformer winding terminal.  In
      earlier CIM versions, the TransformerWinding class served a
      similar purpose, but this class is more flexible because it
      associates to terminal but is not a specialization of
      ConductingEquipment.

      BaseVoltage:
         Base voltage of the transformer end.  This is essential for
         PU calculation. Default: None

      Terminal:
         Terminal of the power transformer to which this transformer
         end belongs. Default: None

      PhaseTapChanger:
         Transformer end to which this phase tap changer belongs.
         Default: None

      RatioTapChanger:
         Transformer end to which this ratio tap changer belongs.
         Default: None

      endNumber:
         Number for this transformer end, corresponding to the end`s
         order in the power transformer vector group or phase angle
         clock number.  Highest voltage winding should be 1.  Each end
         within a power transformer should have a unique subsequent
         end number.   Note the transformer end number need not match
         the terminal sequence number. Default: 0

      rground:
         (for Yn and Zn connections) Resistance part of neutral
         impedance where *grounded* is true. Default: 0.0

      grounded:
         (for Yn and Zn connections) True if the neutral is solidly
         grounded. Default: False

      xground:
         (for Yn and Zn connections) Reactive part of neutral
         impedance where *grounded* is true. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
