cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.Command module
**********************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.Command.Command(normalValue=0, value=0, DiscreteValue=None, ValueAliasSet=None, *args, **kw_args)

      A Command is a discrete control used for supervisory control.

      normalValue:
         Normal value for Control.value e.g. used for percentage
         scaling. Default: 0

      value:
         The value representing the actuator output. Default: 0

      DiscreteValue:
         The Control variable associated with the MeasurementValue.
         Default: None

      ValueAliasSet:
         The ValueAliasSet used for translation of a Control value to
         a name. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class Control:

      Control is used for supervisory/device control. It represents
      control outputs that are used to change the state in a process,
      e.g. close or open breaker, a set point value or a raise lower
      command.

      controlType:
         Specifies the type of Control, e.g. BreakerOn/Off,
         GeneratorVoltageSetPoint, TieLineFlow etc. The
         ControlType.name shall be unique among all specified types
         and describe the type. Default: ''

      operationInProgress:
         Indicates that a client is currently sending control commands
         that has not completed. Default: False

      timeStamp:
         The last time a control output was sent. Default: ''

      unitMultiplier:
         The unit multiplier of the controlled quantity. Default: None

      unitSymbol:
         The unit of measure of the controlled quantity. Default: None

      PowerSystemResource:
         The controller outputs used to actually govern a regulating
         device, e.g. the magnetization of a synchronous machine or
         capacitor bank breaker actuator. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
