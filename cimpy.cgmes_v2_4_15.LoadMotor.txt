      Aggregate induction motor load. This model  is used to represent
      a fraction of an ordinary load as "induction motor load".  It
      allows load that is treated as ordinary constant power in power
      flow analysis to be represented by an induction motor in dynamic
      simulation.  If  = 0. or  = , or  = 0.,  only one cage is
      represented. Magnetic saturation is not modelled. Either a "one-
      cage" or "two-cage" model of the induction machine can be
      modelled. Magnetic saturation is not modelled.  This model is
      intended for representation of aggregations of many motors
      dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but
      where there is no information on the characteristics of
      individual motors.  This model treats a fraction of the constant
      power part of a load as a motor. During initialisation, the
      initial power drawn by the motor is set equal to  times the
      constant  part of the static load.  The remainder of the load is
      left as static load.  The reactive power demand of the motor is
      calculated during initialisation as a function of voltage at the
      load bus. This reactive power demand may be less than or greater
      than the constant  component of the load.  If the motor's
      reactive demand is greater than the constant  component of the
      load, the model inserts a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the
      motor to bring its reactive demand down to equal the constant
      reactive load.   If a motor model and a static load model are
      both present for a load, the motor  is assumed to be subtracted
      from the power flow constant  load before the static load model
      is applied.  The remainder of the load, if any, is then
      represented by the static load model.

      LoadAggregate:
         Aggregate load to which this aggregate motor (dynamic) load
         belongs. Default: None

         Stator resistance (Ra).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      tpo:
         Transient rotor time constant (Tpo) (not=0).  Typical Value =
         1. Default: 0

      tppo:
         Subtransient rotor time constant (Tppo).  Typical Value =
         0.02. Default: 0

      h:
         Inertia constant (H) (not=0).  Typical Value = 0.4. Default:
         0

      d:

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
