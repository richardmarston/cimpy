class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcDC2A.ExcDC2A(ka=0.0, ks=0.0, ta=0, tb=0, tc=0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, ke=0.0, te=0, kf=0.0, tf=0, tf1=0, efd1=0.0, seefd1=0.0, efd2=0.0, seefd2=0.0, exclim=False, vtlim=False, *args, **kw_args)

      Modified IEEE DC2A direct current commutator exciters with speed
      input, one more leg block in feedback loop and without
      underexcitation limiters (UEL) inputs.  DC type 2 excitation
      system model with added speed multiplier, added lead-lag, and
      voltage-dependent limits.

      ka:
         Voltage regulator gain (Ka).  Typical Value = 300. Default:
         0.0

         Coefficient to allow different usage of the model-speed
         coefficient (Ks).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      ta:
         Voltage regulator time constant (Ta).  Typical Value = 0.01.
         Default: 0

      tb:
         Voltage regulator time constant (Tb).  Typical Value = 0.

      ke:
         Exciter constant related to self-excited field (Ke).  If Ke
         is entered as zero, the model calculates an effective value
         of Ke such that the initial condition value of Vr is zero.
         The zero value of Ke is not changed.  If Ke is entered as
         non-zero, its value is used directly, without change.

         exciter control (Te).  Typical Value = 1.33. Default: 0

         Default: 0.0

      efd2:
         Exciter voltage at which exciter saturation is defined
         (Efd2).  Typical Value = 2.29. Default: 0.0

      seefd2:
         Exciter saturation function value at the corresponding
         exciter voltage, Efd2 (Se[Efd2]).  Typical Value = 0.117.
         Default: 0.0

      exclim:
         (exclim).  IEEE standard is ambiguous about lower limit on
         exciter output. true = a lower limit of zero is applied to
         integrator output false = a lower limit of zero is not
         applied to integrator output. Typical Value = true. Default:
         False

      vtlim:
         (Vtlim). true = limiter at the block [Ka/(1+sTa)] is
         dependent on Vt  false = limiter at the block is not
         dependent on Vt. Typical Value = true. Default: False

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
