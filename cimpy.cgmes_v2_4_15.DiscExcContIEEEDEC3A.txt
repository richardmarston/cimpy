cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.DiscExcContIEEEDEC3A module
***********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.DiscExcContIEEEDEC3A.DiscExcContIEEEDEC3A(vtmin=0.0, tdr=0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Type DEC3A model. In some systems, the
      stabilizer output is disconnected from the regulator immediately
      following a severe fault to prevent the stabilizer from
      competing with action of voltage regulator during the first
      swing.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 12.4.

      vtmin:
         Terminal undervoltage comparison level (). Default: 0.0

      tdr:
         Reset time delay (). Default: 0

   Documentation of parent class
   DiscontinuousExcitationControlDynamics:

      Discontinuous excitation control function block whose behaviour
      is described by reference to a standard model .

      RemoteInputSignal:
         Remote input signal used by this discontinuous excitation
         control system model. Default: None

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this discontinuous
         excitation control model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
