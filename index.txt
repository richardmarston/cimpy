CIMpy
*****

The CIMpy package enables the import, modification and export of grid
data in the format of XML/RDF documents based on the Common
Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard.

The processing of grid data is based on CIM compatible Python classes.
The codebase for the CIM compatible Python classes was generated in an
automated way. A separate tool allows for an easy adaption of CIMpy
and its underlying codebase.

The focus of CIMpy is on the support of the Common Grid Model Exchange
Standard (CGMES) specified by the European Network of Transmission
System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). However, the CIMpy package
can readily support further as well as new CIM versions if required.
