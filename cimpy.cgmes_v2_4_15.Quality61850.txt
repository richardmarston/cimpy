***************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.Quality61850.Quality61850(badReference=False, estimatorReplaced=False, failure=False, oldData=False, operatorBlocked=False, oscillatory=False, outOfRange=False, overFlow=False, source=None, suspect=False, test=False, validity=None)

   Quality flags in this class are as defined in IEC 61850, except for
   estimatorReplaced, which has been included in this class for
   convenience.

   BadReference:
      Measurement value may be incorrect due to a reference being out
      of calibration. Default: False

   EstimatorReplaced:
      Value has been replaced by State Estimator. estimatorReplaced is
      not an IEC61850 quality bit but has been put in this class for
      convenience. Default: False

   Failure:
      This identifier indicates that a supervision function has
      detected an internal or external failure, e.g. communication
      failure. Default: False

   OldData:
      Measurement value is old and possibly invalid, as it has not
      been successfully updated during a specified time interval.
      Default: False

   OperatorBlocked:
      Measurement value is blocked and hence unavailable for
      transmission. Default: False

   Oscillatory:
      To prevent some overload of the communication it is sensible to
      detect and suppress oscillating (fast changing) binary inputs.
      If a signal changes in a defined time (tosc) twice in the same
      direction (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) then oscillation is
      detected and the detail quality identifier *oscillatory* is set.
      If it is detected a configured numbers of transient changes
      could be passed by. In this time the validity status
      *questionable* is set. If after this defined numbers of changes
      the signal is still in the oscillating state the value shall be
      set either to the opposite state of the previous stable value or
      to a defined default value. In this case the validity status
      *questionable* is reset and *invalid* is set as long as the
      signal is oscillating. If it is configured such that no
      transient changes should be passed by then the validity status
      *invalid* is set immediately in addition to the detail quality
      identifier *oscillatory* (used for status information only).
      Default: False

   OutOfRange:
      Measurement value is beyond a predefined range of value.
      Default: False

   OverFlow:
      Measurement value is beyond the capability of being  represented
      properly. For example, a counter value overflows from maximum
      count back to a value of zero. Default: False

   Source:
      Source gives information related to the origin of a value. The
      value may be acquired from the process, defaulted or
      substituted. Default: None

   Suspect:
      A correlation function has detected that the value is not
      consitent with other values. Typically set by a network State
      Estimator. Default: False

   Test:
      Measurement value is transmitted for test purposes. Default:
      False

   Validity:
      Validity of the measurement value. Default: None
