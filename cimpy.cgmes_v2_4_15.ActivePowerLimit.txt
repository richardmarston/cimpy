cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ActivePowerLimit module
*******************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ActivePowerLimit.ActivePowerLimit(value=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      Limit on active power flow.

      value:
         Value of active power limit. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class OperationalLimit:

      A value associated with a specific kind of limit.  The sub class
      value attribute shall be positive.  The sub class value
      attribute is inversely proportional to
      OperationalLimitType.acceptableDuration (acceptableDuration for
      short). A pair of value_x and acceptableDuration_x are related
      to each other as follows: if value_1 > value_2 > value_3 >...
      then acceptableDuration_1 < acceptableDuration_2 <
      acceptableDuration_3 < ... A value_x with direction="high" shall
      be greater than a value_y with direction="low".

      OperationalLimitSet:
         Values of equipment limits. Default: None

      OperationalLimitType:
         The limit type associated with this limit. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
