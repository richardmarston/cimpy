class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ACDCTerminal.ACDCTerminal(BusNameMarker=None, sequenceNumber=0, OperationalLimitSet='list', Measurements='list', connected=False, *args, **kw_args)

      An electrical connection point (AC or DC) to a piece of
      conducting equipment. Terminals are connected at physical
      connection points called connectivity nodes.

      BusNameMarker:
         The bus name marker used to name the bus (topological node).
         Default: None

      sequenceNumber:
         The orientation of the terminal connections for a multiple
         terminal conducting equipment.  The sequence numbering starts
         with 1 and additional terminals should follow in increasing
         order.   The first terminal is the *starting point* for a two
         terminal branch. Default: 0

      OperationalLimitSet:
         Default: "list"

      Measurements:
         Measurements associated with this terminal defining  where
         the measurement is placed in the network topology.  It may be
         used, for instance, to capture the sensor position, such as a
         voltage transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer
         (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. Default:
         "list"

      connected:
         The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the
         topological node to terminal relation.  True implies the
         terminal is connected to the related topological node and
         false implies it is not.  In a bus-branch model, the
         connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected
         without having to change the connectivity described by the
         topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that
         conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in
         the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the
         reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant
         case. Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
