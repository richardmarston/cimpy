**************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.AnalogValue.AnalogValue(Analog=None, AnalogControl=None, value=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      AnalogValue represents an analog MeasurementValue.

      Analog:
         The values connected to this measurement. Default: None

      AnalogControl:
         The MeasurementValue that is controlled. Default: None

      value:
         The value to supervise. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class MeasurementValue:

      The current state for a measurement. A state value is an
      instance of a measurement from a specific source. Measurements
      can be associated with many state values, each representing a
      different source for the measurement.

      timeStamp:
         The time when the value was last updated Default: ''

      sensorAccuracy:
         The limit, expressed as a percentage of the sensor maximum,
         that errors will not exceed when the sensor is used under
         reference conditions. Default: 0.0

      MeasurementValueQuality:
         A MeasurementValue has a MeasurementValueQuality associated
         with it. Default: None

      MeasurementValueSource:
         The MeasurementValues updated by the source. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
