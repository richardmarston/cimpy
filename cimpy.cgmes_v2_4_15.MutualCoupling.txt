*****************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.MutualCoupling.MutualCoupling(First_Terminal=None, Second_Terminal=None, b0ch=0.0, distance11=0.0, distance12=0.0, distance21=0.0, distance22=0.0, g0ch=0.0, r0=0.0, x0=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      This class represents the zero sequence line mutual coupling.

      First_Terminal:
         The starting terminal for the calculation of distances along
         the first branch of the mutual coupling.  Normally
         MutualCoupling would only be used for terminals of AC line
         segments.  The first and second terminals of a mutual
         coupling should point to different AC line segments. Default:
         None

      Second_Terminal:
         The starting terminal for the calculation of distances along
         the second branch of the mutual coupling. Default: None

      b0ch:
         Zero sequence mutual coupling shunt (charging) susceptance,
         uniformly distributed, of the entire line section. Default:
         0.0

      distance11:
         Distance to the start of the coupled region from the first
         line`s terminal having sequence number equal to 1. Default:
         0.0

      distance12:
         Distance to the end of the coupled region from the first
         line`s terminal with sequence number equal to 1. Default: 0.0

      distance21:
         Distance to the start of coupled region from the second
         line`s terminal with sequence number equal to 1. Default: 0.0

      distance22:
         Distance to the end of coupled region from the second line`s
         terminal with sequence number equal to 1. Default: 0.0

      g0ch:
         Zero sequence mutual coupling shunt (charging) conductance,
         uniformly distributed, of the entire line section. Default:
         0.0

      r0:
         Zero sequence branch-to-branch mutual impedance coupling,
         resistance. Default: 0.0

      x0:
         Zero sequence branch-to-branch mutual impedance coupling,
         reactance. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
