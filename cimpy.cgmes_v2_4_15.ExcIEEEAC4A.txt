class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEAC4A.ExcIEEEAC4A(vimax=0.0, vimin=0.0, tc=0, tb=0, ka=0.0, ta=0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, kc=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC4A model. The
      model represents type AC4A alternator-supplied controlled-
      rectifier excitation system which is quite different from the
      other type ac systems. This high initial response excitation
      system utilizes a full thyristor bridge in the exciter output
      circuit.  The voltage regulator controls the firing of the
      thyristor bridges. The exciter alternator uses an independent
      voltage regulator to control its output voltage to a constant
      value. These effects are not modeled; however, transient loading
      effects on the exciter alternator are included.   Reference:
      IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 6.4.

      reference to a standard model

      SynchronousMachineDynamics:
         Synchronous machine model with which this excitation system
         model is associated. Default: None

      PowerSystemStabilizerDynamics:
         Power system stabilizer model associated with this excitation
         system model. Default: None

      PFVArControllerType1Dynamics:
         Power Factor or VAr controller Type I model associated with
         this excitation system model. Default: None

      VoltageCompensatorDynamics:

         system model. Default: None

         excitation system model. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
