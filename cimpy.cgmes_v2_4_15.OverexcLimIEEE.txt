class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.OverexcLimIEEE.OverexcLimIEEE(itfpu=0.0, ifdmax=0.0, ifdlim=0.0, hyst=0.0, kcd=0.0, kramp=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The over excitation limiter model is intended to represent the
      significant features of OELs necessary for some large-scale
      system studies. It is the result of a pragmatic approach to
      obtain a model that can be widely applied with attainable data
      from generator owners. An attempt to include all variations in
      the functionality of OELs and duplicate how they interact with
      the rest of the excitation systems would likely result in a
      level of application insufficient for the studies for which they
      are intended.  Reference: IEEE OEL 421.5-2005 Section 9.

      itfpu:
         OEL timed field current limiter pickup level (I).  Typical
         Value = 1.05. Default: 0.0

      ifdmax:
         OEL instantaneous field current limit (I).  Typical Value =
         1.5. Default: 0.0

      ifdlim:
         OEL timed field current limit (I).  Typical Value = 1.05.
         Default: 0.0

      hyst:
         OEL pickup/drop-out hysteresis (HYST).  Typical Value = 0.03.
         Default: 0.0

      kcd:
         OEL cooldown gain (K).  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0

      kramp:
         OEL ramped limit rate (K).  Unit = PU/sec.  Typical Value =
         10. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class OverexcitationLimiterDynamics:

      Overexcitation limiter function block whose behaviour is
      described by reference to a standard model

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this overexcitation
         limiter model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
