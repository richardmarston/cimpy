class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEST7B.ExcIEEEST7B(kh=0.0, kia=0.0, kl=0.0, kpa=0.0, oelin=None, tb=0, tc=0, tf=0, tg=0, tia=0, uelin=None, vmax=0.0, vmin=0.0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type ST7B model. This
      model is representative of static potential-source excitation
      systems. In this system, the AVR consists of a PI voltage
      regulator. A phase lead-lag filter in series allows introduction
      of a derivative function, typically used with brushless
      excitation systems. In that case, the regulator is of the PID
      type. In addition, the terminal voltage channel includes a phase
      lead-lag filter.  The AVR includes the appropriate inputs on its
      reference for overexcitation limiter (OEL1), underexcitation
      limiter (UEL), stator current limiter (SCL), and current
      compensator (DROOP). All these limitations, when they work at
      voltage reference level, keep the PSS (VS signal from Type
      PSS1A, PSS2A, or PSS2B) in operation. However, the UEL
      limitation can also be transferred to the high value (HV) gate
      acting on the output signal. In addition, the output signal
      passes through a low value (LV) gate for a ceiling
      overexcitation limiter (OEL2).  Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 7.7.

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''
