      Rotor resistance control model.  Reference: IEC Standard
      61400-27-1 Section 6.6.5.2.

      kirr:
         Integral gain in rotor resistance PI controller (). It is
         type dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      komegafilt:
         Filter gain for generator speed measurement (K). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      kpfilt:
         Filter gain for power measurement (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      kprr:
         Proportional gain in rotor resistance PI controller (). It is
         type dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      rmax:
         Maximum rotor resistance (). It is type dependent parameter.
         Default: 0.0

      rmin:
         Minimum rotor resistance (). It is type dependent parameter.
         Default: 0.0

      tomegafilt:
         Filter time constant for generator speed measurement (). It
         is type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      tpfilt:
         Filter time constant for power measurement (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

      WindDynamicsLookupTable:
         The wind dynamics lookup table associated with this rotor
         resistance control model. Default: "list"

      WindGenTurbineType2IEC:
         Wind turbine type 2 model with whitch this wind control rotor
         resistance model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
