class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.NonlinearShuntCompensator.NonlinearShuntCompensator(NonlinearShuntCompensatorPoints='list', *args, **kw_args)

      A non linear shunt compensator has bank or section admittance
      values that differs.

      NonlinearShuntCompensatorPoints:
         All points of the non-linear shunt compensator. Default:
         "list"

   Documentation of parent class ShuntCompensator:

      A shunt capacitor or reactor or switchable bank of shunt
      capacitors or reactors. A section of a shunt compensator is an
      individual capacitor or reactor.  A negative value for
      reactivePerSection indicates that the compensator is a reactor.
      ShuntCompensator is a single terminal device.  Ground is
      implied.

      aVRDelay:
         Time delay required for the device to be connected or
         disconnected by automatic voltage regulation (AVR). Default:
         0

      grounded:
         Used for Yn and Zn connections. True if the neutral is
         solidly grounded. Default: False

      maximumSections:
         The maximum number of sections that may be switched in.
         Default: 0

      nomU:
         The voltage at which the nominal reactive power may be
         calculated. This should normally be within 10% of the voltage
         at which the capacitor is connected to the network. Default:
         0.0

      normalSections:
         The normal number of sections switched in. Default: 0

      switchOnCount:
         The switch on count since the capacitor count was last reset
         or initialized. Default: 0

      switchOnDate:
         The date and time when the capacitor bank was last switched
         on. Default: ''

      voltageSensitivity:
         Voltage sensitivity required for the device to regulate the
         bus voltage, in voltage/reactive power. Default: 0.0

      sections:
         Shunt compensator sections in use. Starting value for steady
         state solution. Non integer values are allowed to support
         continuous variables. The reasons for continuous value are to
         support study cases where no discrete shunt compensators has
         yet been designed, a solutions where a narrow voltage band
         force the sections to oscillate or accommodate for a
         continuous solution as input. Default: 0.0

      SvShuntCompensatorSections:
         The state for the number of shunt compensator sections in
         service. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class RegulatingCondEq:

      A type of conducting equipment that can regulate a quantity
      (i.e. voltage or flow) at a specific point in the network.

      RegulatingControl:
         The regulating control scheme in which this equipment
         participates. Default: None

      controlEnabled:
         Specifies the regulation status of the equipment.  True is
         regulating, false is not regulating. Default: False

   Documentation of parent class ConductingEquipment:

      The parts of the AC power system that are designed to carry
      current or that are conductively connected through terminals.

      BaseVoltage:
         All conducting equipment with this base voltage.  Use only
         when there is no voltage level container used and only one
         base voltage applies.  For example, not used for
         transformers. Default: None

      Terminals:
         Conducting equipment have terminals that may be connected to
         other conducting equipment terminals via connectivity nodes
         or topological nodes. Default: "list"

      SvStatus:
         The status state variable associated with this conducting
         equipment. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class Equipment:

      The parts of a power system that are physical devices,
      electronic or mechanical.

      aggregate:
         The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces
         of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.
         Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines
         operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power
         transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to
         be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of
         interdependent equipment produced by a network production
         program. Default: False

      EquipmentContainer:
         Container of this equipment. Default: None

      OperationalLimitSet:
         The operational limit sets associated with this equipment.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
