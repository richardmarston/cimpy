class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ConnectivityNode.ConnectivityNode(Terminals='list', ConnectivityNodeContainer=None, TopologicalNode=None, boundaryPoint=False, fromEndIsoCode='', fromEndName='', fromEndNameTso='', toEndIsoCode='', toEndName='', toEndNameTso='', *args, **kw_args)

      Connectivity nodes are points where terminals of AC conducting
      equipment are connected together with zero impedance.

      Terminals:
         The connectivity node to which this terminal connects with
         zero impedance. Default: "list"

      ConnectivityNodeContainer:
         Container of this connectivity node. Default: None

      TopologicalNode:
         The connectivity nodes combine together to form this
         topological node.  May depend on the current state of
         switches in the network. Default: None

      boundaryPoint:
         Identifies if a node is a BoundaryPoint. If
         boundaryPoint=true the ConnectivityNode or the
         TopologicalNode represents a BoundaryPoint. Default: False

      fromEndIsoCode:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the ISO code of the
         region to which the *From* side of the Boundary point belongs
         to or it is connected to. The ISO code is two characters
         country code as defined by ISO 3166 (). The length of the
         string is 2 characters maximum. The attribute is a required
         for the Boundary Model Authority Set where this attribute is
         used only for the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology
         profile and ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment
         profile. Default: ''

      fromEndName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         name with length of the string 32 characters maximum. The
         attribute covers two cases:  The attribute is required for
         the Boundary Model Authority Set where it is used only for
         the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology profile and
         ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment profile. Default:
         ''

      fromEndNameTso:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the name of the TSO
         to which the *From* side of the Boundary point belongs to or
         it is connected to. The length of the string is 32 characters
         maximum. The attribute is required for the Boundary Model
         Authority Set where it is used only for the TopologicalNode
         in the Boundary Topology profile and ConnectivityNode in the
         Boundary Equipment profile. Default: ''

      toEndIsoCode:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the ISO code of the
         region to which the *To* side of the Boundary point belongs
         to or it is connected to. The ISO code is two characters
         country code as defined by ISO 3166 (). The length of the
         string is 2 characters maximum. The attribute is a required
         for the Boundary Model Authority Set where this attribute is
         used only for the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology
         profile and ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment
         profile. Default: ''

      toEndName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         name with length of the string 32 characters maximum. The
         attribute covers two cases:  The attribute is required for
         the Boundary Model Authority Set where it is used only for
         the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology profile and
         ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment profile. Default:
         ''

      toEndNameTso:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the name of the TSO
         to which the *To* side of the Boundary point belongs to or it
         is connected to. The length of the string is 32 characters
         maximum. The attribute is required for the Boundary Model
         Authority Set where it is used only for the TopologicalNode
         in the Boundary Topology profile and ConnectivityNode in the
         Boundary Equipment profile. Default: ''

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
