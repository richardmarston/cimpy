class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ControlArea.ControlArea(type=None, TieFlow='list', ControlAreaGeneratingUnit='list', EnergyArea=None, netInterchange=0.0, pTolerance=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      A control areais a grouping of generating units and/or loads and
      a cutset of tie lines (as terminals) which may be used for a
      variety of purposes including automatic generation control,
      powerflow solution area interchange control specification, and
      input to load forecasting.   Note that any number of overlapping
      control area specifications can be superimposed on the physical
      model.

      type:
         The primary type of control area definition used to determine
         if this is used for automatic generation control, for
         planning interchange control, or other purposes.   A control
         area specified with primary type of automatic generation
         control could still be forecast and used as an interchange
         area in power flow analysis. Default: None

      TieFlow:
         The tie flows associated with the control area. Default:
         "list"

      ControlAreaGeneratingUnit:
         The generating unit specificaitons for the control area.
         Default: "list"

      EnergyArea:
         The energy area that is forecast from this control area
         specification. Default: None

      netInterchange:
         The specified positive net interchange into the control area,
         i.e. positive sign means flow in to the area. Default: 0.0

      pTolerance:
         Active power net interchange tolerance Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.
         Default: "list"

      Location:
         Location of this power system resource. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
