class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PFVArType2IEEEPFController.PFVArType2IEEEPFController(pfref=0.0, vref=0.0, vclmt=0.0, kp=0.0, ki=0.0, vs=0.0, exlon=False, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE PF Controller Type 2 which is a
      summing point type controller and makes up the outside loop of a
      two-loop system. This controller is implemented as a slow PI
      type controller. The voltage regulator forms the inner loop and
      is implemented as a fast controller.  Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 11.4.

      pfref:
         Power factor reference (). Default: 0.0

      vref:
         Voltage regulator reference (). Default: 0.0

      vclmt:
         Maximum output of the pf controller ().  Typical Value = 0.1.
         Default: 0.0

      kp:
         Proportional gain of the pf controller ().  Typical Value =
         1. Default: 0.0

      ki:
         Integral gain of the pf controller ().  Typical Value = 1.
         Default: 0.0

      vs:
         Generator sensing voltage (). Default: 0.0

      exlon:
         Overexcitation or under excitation flag () true = 1 (not in
         the overexcitation or underexcitation state, integral action
         is active) false = 0 (in the overexcitation or
         underexcitation state, so integral action is disabled to
         allow the limiter to play its role). Default: False

   Documentation of parent class PFVArControllerType2Dynamics:

      Power Factor or VAr controller Type II function block whose
      behaviour is described by reference to a standard model

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this Power Factor or VAr
         controller Type II is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
