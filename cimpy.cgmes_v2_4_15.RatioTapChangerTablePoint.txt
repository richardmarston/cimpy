class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.RatioTapChangerTablePoint.RatioTapChangerTablePoint(RatioTapChangerTable=None, *args, **kw_args)

      Describes each tap step in the ratio tap changer tabular curve.

      RatioTapChangerTable:
         Points of this table. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class TapChangerTablePoint:

      b:
         The magnetizing branch susceptance deviation in percent of
         nominal value. The actual susceptance is calculated as
         follows: calculated magnetizing susceptance = b(nominal) * (1
         + b(from this class)/100).   The b(nominal) is defined as the
         static magnetizing susceptance on the associated power
         transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star
         impedance (pi model) form. Default: 0.0

      g:
         The magnetizing branch conductance deviation in percent of
         nominal value. The actual conductance is calculated as
         follows: calculated magnetizing conductance = g(nominal) * (1
         + g(from this class)/100).   The g(nominal) is defined as the
         static magnetizing conductance on the associated power
         transformer end or ends.  This model assumes the star
         impedance (pi model) form. Default: 0.0

      r:
         The resistance deviation in percent of nominal value. The
         actual reactance is calculated as follows: calculated
         resistance = r(nominal) * (1 + r(from this class)/100).   The
         r(nominal) is defined as the static resistance on the
         associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes
         the star impedance (pi model) form. Default: 0.0

      ratio:
         The voltage ratio in per unit. Hence this is a value close to
         one. Default: 0.0

      step:
         The tap step. Default: 0

      x:
         The series reactance deviation in percent of nominal value.
         The actual reactance is calculated as follows: calculated
         reactance = x(nominal) * (1 + x(from this class)/100).   The
         x(nominal) is defined as the static series reactance on the
         associated power transformer end or ends.  This model assumes
         the star impedance (pi model) form. Default: 0.0
