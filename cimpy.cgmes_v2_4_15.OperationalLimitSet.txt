**********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.OperationalLimitSet.OperationalLimitSet(Terminal=None, Equipment=None, OperationalLimitValue='list', *args, **kw_args)

      A set of limits associated with equipment.  Sets of limits might
      apply to a specific temperature, or season for example. A set of
      limits may contain different severities of limit levels that
      would apply to the same equipment. The set may contain limits of
      different types such as apparent power and current limits or
      high and low voltage limits  that are logically applied together
      as a set.

      Terminal:
         Default: None

      Equipment:
         The equipment to which the limit set applies. Default: None

      OperationalLimitValue:
         The limit set to which the limit values belong. Default:
         "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
