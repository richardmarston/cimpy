      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC3A model. The
      model represents the field-controlled alternator-rectifier
      excitation systems designated Type AC3A. These excitation
      systems include an alternator main exciter with non-controlled
      rectifiers. The exciter employs self-excitation, and the voltage
      regulator power is derived from the exciter output voltage.
      Therefore, this system has an additional nonlinearity, simulated
      by the use of a multiplier whose inputs are the voltage
      regulator command signal, , and the exciter output voltage, ,
      times .  This model is applicable to excitation systems
      employing static voltage regulators.   Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 6.3.

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
