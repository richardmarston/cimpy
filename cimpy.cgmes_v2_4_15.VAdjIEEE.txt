class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.VAdjIEEE.VAdjIEEE(vadjf=0.0, adjslew=0.0, vadjmax=0.0, vadjmin=0.0, taon=0, taoff=0, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Voltage Adjuster which is used to
      represent the voltage adjuster in either a power factor or var
      control system.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section
      11.1.

      vadjf:
         Set high to provide a continuous raise or lower (). Default:
         0.0

      adjslew:
         Rate at which output of adjuster changes ().  Unit = sec./PU.
         Typical Value = 300. Default: 0.0

      vadjmax:
         Maximum output of the adjuster ().  Typical Value = 1.1.
         Default: 0.0

      vadjmin:
         Minimum output of the adjuster ().  Typical Value = 0.9.
         Default: 0.0

      taon:
         Time that adjuster pulses are on ().  Typical Value = 0.1.
         Default: 0

      taoff:
         Time that adjuster pulses are off ().  Typical Value = 0.5.
         Default: 0

   Documentation of parent class VoltageAdjusterDynamics:

      Voltage adjuster function block whose behaviour is described by
      reference to a standard model

      PFVArControllerType1Dynamics:
         Power Factor or VAr controller Type I model with which this
         voltage adjuster is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
