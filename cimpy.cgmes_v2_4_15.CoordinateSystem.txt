cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.CoordinateSystem module
*******************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.CoordinateSystem.CoordinateSystem(crsUrn='', Location='list', *args, **kw_args)

      Coordinate reference system.

      crsUrn:
         A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for the coordinate reference
         system (crs) used to define *Location.PositionPoints*. An
         example would be the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG)
         code for a coordinate reference system, defined in URN under
         the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) namespace as:
         urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::XXXX, where XXXX is an EPSG code (a
         full list of codes can be found at the EPSG Registry web site
         http://www.epsg-registry.org/). To define the coordinate
         system as being WGS84 (latitude, longitude) using an EPSG
         OGC, this attribute would be urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::4236. A
         profile should limit this code to a set of allowed URNs
         agreed to by all sending and receiving parties. Default: ''

      Location:
         All locations described with position points in this
         coordinate system. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
