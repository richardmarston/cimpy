cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.SvPowerFlow module
**************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.SvPowerFlow.SvPowerFlow(Terminal=None, p=0.0, q=0.0)

   State variable for power flow. Load convention is used for flow
   direction. This means flow out from the TopologicalNode into the
   equipment is positive.

   Terminal:
      The terminal associated with the power flow state variable.
      Default: None

   P:
      The active power flow. Load sign convention is used, i.e.
      positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into
      the conducting equipment. Default: 0.0

   Q:
      The reactive power flow. Load sign convention is used, i.e.
      positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into
      the conducting equipment. Default: 0.0
