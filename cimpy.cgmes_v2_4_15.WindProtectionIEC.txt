class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.WindProtectionIEC.WindProtectionIEC(fover=0.0, funder=0.0, tfover=0, tfunder=0, tuover=0, tuunder=0, uover=0.0, uunder=0.0, WindTurbineType3or4IEC=None, WindTurbineType1or2IEC=None, *args, **kw_args)

      The grid protection model includes protection against over and
      under voltage, and against over and under frequency.  Reference:
      IEC Standard 614000-27-1 Section 6.6.6.

      fover:
         Set of wind turbine over frequency protection levels (). It
         is project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      funder:
         Set of wind turbine under frequency protection levels (). It
         is project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      tfover:
         Set of corresponding wind turbine over frequency protection
         disconnection times (). It is project dependent parameter.
         Default: 0

      tfunder:
         Set of corresponding wind turbine under frequency protection
         disconnection times (). It is project dependent parameter.
         Default: 0

      tuover:
         Set of corresponding wind turbine over voltage protection
         disconnection times (). It is project dependent parameter.
         Default: 0

      tuunder:
         Set of corresponding wind turbine under voltage protection
         disconnection times (). It is project dependent parameter.
         Default: 0

      uover:
         Set of wind turbine over voltage protection levels (). It is
         project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      uunder:
         Set of wind turbine under voltage protection levels (). It is
         project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      WindTurbineType3or4IEC:
         Wind generator type 3 or 4 model with which this wind turbine
         protection model is associated. Default: None

      WindTurbineType1or2IEC:
         Wind generator type 1 or 2 model with which this wind turbine
         protection model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
