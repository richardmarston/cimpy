This load is usually the aggregation of many individual load devices and the load model is approximate representation of the aggregate response of the load devices to system disturbances. The load model is always applied to individual bus loads (energy consumers) but a single set of load model parameters can used for all loads in the grouping." alt="" coords="7,152,117,177"/>
