For symmetrical, transposed 3ph lines, it is sufficient to use &#160;attributes of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the entire length of the segment. &#160;Additionally impedances can be computed by using length and associated per length impedances. The BaseVoltage at the two ends of ACLineSegments in a Line shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines &#160;may have slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and &#160;variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch." alt="" coords="27,445,144,471"/>
