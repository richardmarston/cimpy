In case multiple equipment, possibly of different types, control same terminal there must be only one RegulatingControl at that terminal. The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap changers. For flow control &#160;load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment." alt="" coords="22,225,149,251"/>
