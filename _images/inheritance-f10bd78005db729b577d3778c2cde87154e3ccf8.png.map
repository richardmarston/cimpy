This model &#160;is used to represent a fraction of an ordinary load as &quot;induction motor load&quot;. &#160;It allows load that is treated as ordinary constant power in power flow analysis to be represented by an induction motor in dynamic simulation. &#160;If &#160;= 0. or &#160;= , or &#160;= 0., &#160;only one cage is represented. Magnetic saturation is not modelled. Either a &quot;one&#45;cage&quot; or &quot;two&#45;cage&quot; model of the induction machine can be modelled. Magnetic saturation is not modelled. &#160;This model is intended for representation of aggregations of many motors dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but where there is no information on the characteristics of individual motors. &#160;This model treats a fraction of the constant power part of a load as a motor. During initialisation, the initial power drawn by the motor is set equal to &#160;times the constant &#160;part of the static load. &#160;The remainder of the load is left as static load. &#160;The reactive power demand of the motor is calculated during initialisation as a function of voltage at the load bus. This reactive power demand may be less than or greater than the constant &#160;component of the load. &#160;If the motor&#39;s reactive demand is greater than the constant &#160;component of the load, the model inserts a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the motor to bring its reactive demand down to equal the constant &#160;reactive load. &#160;&#160;If a motor model and a static load model are both present for a load, the motor &#160;is assumed to be subtracted from the power flow constant &#160;load before the static load model is applied. &#160;The remainder of the load, if any, is then represented by the static load model." alt="" coords="21,152,103,177"/>
