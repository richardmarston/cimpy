This model represents represent older systems, in particular those dc commutator exciters with non&#45;continuously acting regulators that were commonly used before the development of the continuously acting varieties. &#160;These systems respond at basically two different rates, depending upon the magnitude of voltage error. For small errors, adjustment is made periodically with a signal to a motor&#45;operated rheostat. Larger errors cause resistors to be quickly shorted or inserted and a strong forcing signal applied to the exciter. Continuous motion of the motor&#45;operated rheostat occurs for these larger error signals, even though it is bypassed by contactor action. &#160;&#160;Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5&#45;2005 Section 5.3." alt="" coords="41,299,153,324"/>
