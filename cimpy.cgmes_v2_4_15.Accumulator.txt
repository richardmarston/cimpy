**************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.Accumulator.Accumulator(LimitSets='list', AccumulatorValues='list', *args, **kw_args)

      Accumulator represents an accumulated (counted) Measurement,
      e.g. an energy value.

      LimitSets:
         The Measurements using the LimitSet. Default: "list"

      AccumulatorValues:
         Measurement to which this value is connected. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class Measurement:

      A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-
      measured non-calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment may
      contain Measurements, e.g. a substation may have temperature
      measurements and door open indications, a transformer may have
      oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may
      contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may
      contain a switch status measurement.  The PSR - Measurement
      association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and
      is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer.
      The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs, e.g.
      Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement. Some
      Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor
      location in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer (PT) at a
      busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a
      breaker and an isolator. The sensing position is not captured in
      the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is captured by the
      Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the
      sensing location in the network topology. The location is
      defined by the connection of the Terminal to
      ConductingEquipment.  If both a Terminal and PSR are associated,
      and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated
      Terminal should belong to that ConductingEquipment instance.
      When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and
      Measurement-Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal
      association is never used alone.

      measurementType:
         Specifies the type of measurement.  For example, this
         specifies if the measurement represents an indoor
         temperature, outdoor temperature, bus voltage, line flow,
         etc. Default: ''

      phases:
         Indicates to which phases the measurement applies and avoids
         the need to use *measurementType* to also encode phase
         information (which would explode the types). The phase
         information in Measurement, along with *measurementType* and
         *phases* uniquely defines a Measurement for a device, based
         on normal network phase. Their meaning will not change when
         the computed energizing phasing is changed due to jumpers or
         other reasons. If the attribute is missing three phases (ABC)
         shall be assumed. Default: None

      unitSymbol:
         The unit of measure of the measured quantity. Default: None

      unitMultiplier:
         The unit multiplier of the measured quantity. Default: None

      Terminal:
         One or more measurements may be associated with a terminal in
         the network. Default: None

      PowerSystemResource:
         The measurements associated with this power system resource.
         Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
