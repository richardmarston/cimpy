class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PhaseTapChangerNonLinear.PhaseTapChangerNonLinear(voltageStepIncrement=0.0, xMax=0.0, xMin=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      The non-linear phase tap changer describes the non-linear
      behavior of a phase tap changer. This is a base class for the
      symmetrical and asymmetrical phase tap changer models. The
      details of these models can be found in the IEC 61970-301
      document.

      voltageStepIncrement:
         The voltage step increment on the out of phase winding
         specified in percent of nominal voltage of the transformer
         end. Default: 0.0

      xMax:
         The reactance depend on the tap position according to a *u*
         shaped curve. The maximum reactance (xMax) appear at the low
         and high tap positions. Default: 0.0

      xMin:
         The reactance depend on the tap position according to a *u*
         shaped curve. The minimum reactance (xMin) appear at the mid
         tap position. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class PhaseTapChanger:

      A transformer phase shifting tap model that controls the phase
      angle difference across the power transformer and potentially
      the active power flow through the power transformer.  This phase
      tap model may also impact the voltage magnitude.

      TransformerEnd:
         Phase tap changer associated with this transformer end.
         Default: None

   Documentation of parent class TapChanger:

      Mechanism for changing transformer winding tap positions.

      highStep:
         Highest possible tap step position, advance from neutral. The
         attribute shall be greater than lowStep. Default: 0

      lowStep:
         Lowest possible tap step position, retard from neutral
         Default: 0

      ltcFlag:
         Specifies whether or not a TapChanger has load tap changing
         capabilities. Default: False

      neutralStep:
         The neutral tap step position for this winding. The attribute
         shall be equal or greater than lowStep and equal or less than
         highStep. Default: 0

      neutralU:
         Voltage at which the winding operates at the neutral tap
         setting. Default: 0.0

      normalStep:
         The tap step position used in *normal* network operation for
         this winding. For a *Fixed* tap changer indicates the current
         physical tap setting. The attribute shall be equal or greater
         than lowStep and equal or less than highStep. Default: 0

      TapChangerControl:
         The tap changers that participates in this regulating tap
         control scheme. Default: None

      TapSchedules:
         A TapSchedule is associated with a TapChanger. Default:
         "list"

      controlEnabled:
         Specifies the regulation status of the equipment.  True is
         regulating, false is not regulating. Default: False

      step:
         Tap changer position. Starting step for a steady state
         solution. Non integer values are allowed to support
         continuous tap variables. The reasons for continuous value
         are to support study cases where no discrete tap changers has
         yet been designed, a solutions where a narrow voltage band
         force the tap step to oscillate or accommodate for a
         continuous solution as input. The attribute shall be equal or
         greater than lowStep and equal or less than highStep.
         Default: 0.0

      SvTapStep:
         The tap step state associated with the tap changer. Default:
         None

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.
         Default: "list"

      Location:
         Location of this power system resource. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
