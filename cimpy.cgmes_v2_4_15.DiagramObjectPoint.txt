*********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.DiagramObjectPoint.DiagramObjectPoint(DiagramObject=None, DiagramObjectGluePoint=None, sequenceNumber=0, xPosition=0.0, yPosition=0.0, zPosition=0.0)

   A point in a given space defined by 3 coordinates and associated to
   a diagram object.  The coordinates may be positive or negative as
   the origin does not have to be in the corner of a diagram.

   DiagramObject:
      The diagram object with which the points are associated.
      Default: None

   DiagramObjectGluePoint:
      A diagram object glue point is associated with 2 or more object
      points that are considered to be *glued* together. Default: None

   SequenceNumber:
      The sequence position of the point, used for defining the order
      of points for diagram objects acting as a polyline or polygon
      with more than one point. Default: 0

   XPosition:
      The X coordinate of this point. Default: 0.0

   YPosition:
      The Y coordinate of this point. Default: 0.0

   ZPosition:
      The Z coordinate of this point. Default: 0.0
