      Detailed Excitation System Model - ELIN (VATECH).  This model
      represents an all-static excitation system. A PI voltage
      controller establishes a desired field current set point for a
      proportional current controller. The integrator of the PI
      controller has a follow-up input to match its signal to the
      present field current.  Power system stabilizer models used in
      conjunction with this excitation system model: PssELIN2,
      PssIEEE2B, Pss2B.

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
