***********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.WindPlantUserDefined.WindPlantUserDefined(proprietary=False, ProprietaryParameterDynamics='list', *args, **kw_args)

      Wind plant function block whose dynamic behaviour is described
      by

      proprietary:
         Behaviour is based on proprietary model as opposed to
         detailed model. true = user-defined model is proprietary with
         behaviour mutually understood by sending and receiving
         applications and parameters passed as general attributes
         false = user-defined model is explicitly defined in terms of
         control blocks and their input and output signals. Default:
         False

      ProprietaryParameterDynamics:
         Parameter of this proprietary user-defined model. Default:
         "list"

   Documentation of parent class WindPlantDynamics:

      Parent class supporting relationships to wind turbines Type 3
      and 4 and wind plant IEC and user defined wind plants including
      their control models.

      RemoteInputSignal:
         The wind plant using the remote signal. Default: None

      WindTurbineType3or4Dynamics:
         The wind turbine type 3 or 4 associated with this wind plant.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
