class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TopologicalNode.TopologicalNode(SvInjection=None, SvVoltage=None, AngleRefTopologicalIsland=None, TopologicalIsland=None, BaseVoltage=None, ConnectivityNodes='list', ConnectivityNodeContainer=None, ReportingGroup=None, Terminal='list', boundaryPoint=False, fromEndIsoCode='', fromEndName='', fromEndNameTso='', toEndIsoCode='', toEndName='', toEndNameTso='', *args, **kw_args)

      For a detailed substation model a topological node is a set of
      connectivity nodes that, in the current network state, are
      connected together through any type of closed switches,
      including  jumpers. Topological nodes change as the current
      network state changes (i.e., switches, breakers, etc. change
      state). For a planning model, switch statuses are not used to
      form topological nodes. Instead they are manually created or
      deleted in a model builder tool. Topological nodes maintained
      this way are also called "busses".

      SvInjection:
         The topological node associated with the flow injection state
         variable. Default: None

      SvVoltage:
         The topological node associated with the voltage state.
         Default: None

      AngleRefTopologicalIsland:
         The island for which the node is an angle reference.
         Normally there is one angle reference node for each island.
         Default: None

      TopologicalIsland:
         A topological node belongs to a topological island. Default:
         None

      BaseVoltage:
         The base voltage of the topologocial node. Default: None

      ConnectivityNodes:
         The topological node to which this connectivity node is
         assigned.  May depend on the current state of switches in the
         network. Default: "list"

      ConnectivityNodeContainer:
         The connectivity node container to which the toplogical node
         belongs. Default: None

      ReportingGroup:
         The topological nodes that belong to the reporting group.
         Default: None

      Terminal:
         The topological node associated with the terminal.   This can
         be used as an alternative to the connectivity node path to
         topological node, thus making it unneccesary to model
         connectivity nodes in some cases.   Note that the if
         connectivity nodes are in the model, this association would
         probably not be used as an input specification. Default:
         "list"

      boundaryPoint:
         Identifies if a node is a BoundaryPoint. If
         boundaryPoint=true the ConnectivityNode or the
         TopologicalNode represents a BoundaryPoint. Default: False

      fromEndIsoCode:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the ISO code of the
         region to which the *From* side of the Boundary point belongs
         to or it is connected to. The ISO code is two characters
         country code as defined by ISO 3166 (). The length of the
         string is 2 characters maximum. The attribute is a required
         for the Boundary Model Authority Set where this attribute is
         used only for the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology
         profile and ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment
         profile. Default: ''

      fromEndName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         name with length of the string 32 characters maximum. The
         attribute covers two cases:  The attribute is required for
         the Boundary Model Authority Set where it is used only for
         the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology profile and
         ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment profile. Default:
         ''

      fromEndNameTso:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the name of the TSO
         to which the *From* side of the Boundary point belongs to or
         it is connected to. The length of the string is 32 characters
         maximum. The attribute is required for the Boundary Model
         Authority Set where it is used only for the TopologicalNode
         in the Boundary Topology profile and ConnectivityNode in the
         Boundary Equipment profile. Default: ''

      toEndIsoCode:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the ISO code of the
         region to which the *To* side of the Boundary point belongs
         to or it is connected to. The ISO code is two characters
         country code as defined by ISO 3166 (). The length of the
         string is 2 characters maximum. The attribute is a required
         for the Boundary Model Authority Set where this attribute is
         used only for the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology
         profile and ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment
         profile. Default: ''

      toEndName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         name with length of the string 32 characters maximum. The
         attribute covers two cases:  The attribute is required for
         the Boundary Model Authority Set where it is used only for
         the TopologicalNode in the Boundary Topology profile and
         ConnectivityNode in the Boundary Equipment profile. Default:
         ''

      toEndNameTso:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the name of the TSO
         to which the *To* side of the Boundary point belongs to or it
         is connected to. The length of the string is 32 characters
         maximum. The attribute is required for the Boundary Model
         Authority Set where it is used only for the TopologicalNode
         in the Boundary Topology profile and ConnectivityNode in the
         Boundary Equipment profile. Default: ''

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
