      Pitch angle control model.  Reference: IEC Standard 61400-27-1
      Section 6.6.5.8.

      dthetamax:
         Maximum pitch positive ramp rate (d). It is type dependent
         parameter. Unit = degrees/sec. Default: 0.0

      dthetamin:
         Maximum pitch negative ramp rate (d). It is type dependent
         parameter. Unit = degrees/sec. Default: 0.0

      kic:
         Power PI controller integration gain (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      kiomega:
         Speed PI controller integration gain (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      kpc:
         Power PI controller proportional gain (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      kpomega:
         Speed PI controller proportional gain (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      kpx:
         Pitch cross coupling gain (K). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      thetamax:
         Maximum pitch angle (). It is type dependent parameter.
         Default: 0.0

      thetamin:
         Minimum pitch angle (). It is type dependent parameter.
         Default: 0.0

      ttheta:
         Pitch time constant (t). It is type dependent parameter.
         Default: 0

      WindGenTurbineType3IEC:
         Wind turbine type 3 model with which this pitch control model
         is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
