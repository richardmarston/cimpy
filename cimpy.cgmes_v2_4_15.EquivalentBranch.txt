      aggregate:
         The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces
         of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.
         Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines
         operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power
         transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to
         be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of

      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
