class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PhaseCode.PhaseCode

   Enumeration of phase identifiers. Allows designation of phases for
   both transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads.
   Residential and small commercial loads are often served from
   single-phase, or split-phase, secondary circuits. For example of
   s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of
   phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase
   transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served
   from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase
   loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.
