**************************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.WindDynamicsLookupTable.WindDynamicsLookupTable(WindContCurrLimIEC=None, WindContPType3IEC=None, WindContRotorRIEC=None, input=0.0, lookupTableFunctionType=None, output=0.0, sequence=0, WindPlantFreqPcontrolIEC=None, *args, **kw_args)

      The class models a look up table for the purpose of wind
      standard models.

      WindContCurrLimIEC:
         The wind dynamics lookup table associated with this current
         control limitation model. Default: None

      WindContPType3IEC:
         The wind dynamics lookup table associated with this P control
         type 3 model. Default: None

      WindContRotorRIEC:
         The rotor resistance control model with which this wind
         dynamics lookup table is associated. Default: None

      input:
         Input value (x) for the lookup table function. Default: 0.0

      lookupTableFunctionType:
         Type of the lookup table function. Default: None

      output:
         Output value (y) for the lookup table function. Default: 0.0

      sequence:
         Sequence numbers of the pairs of the input (x) and the output
         (y) of the lookup table function. Default: 0

      WindPlantFreqPcontrolIEC:
         The wind dynamics lookup table associated with this frequency
         and active power wind plant model. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
