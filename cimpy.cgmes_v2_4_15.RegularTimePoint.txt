cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.RegularTimePoint module
*******************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.RegularTimePoint.RegularTimePoint(IntervalSchedule=None, sequenceNumber=0, value1=0.0, value2=0.0)

   Time point for a schedule where the time between the consecutive
   points is constant.

   IntervalSchedule:
      Regular interval schedule containing this time point. Default:
      None

   SequenceNumber:
      The position of the regular time point in the sequence. Note
      that time points don`t have to be sequential, i.e. time points
      may be omitted. The actual time for a RegularTimePoint is
      computed by multiplying the associated regular interval
      schedule`s time step with the regular time point sequence number
      and adding the associated schedules start time. Default: 0

   Value1:
      The first value at the time. The meaning of the value is defined
      by the derived type of the associated schedule. Default: 0.0

   Value2:
      The second value at the time. The meaning of the value is
      defined by the derived type of the associated schedule. Default:
      0.0
