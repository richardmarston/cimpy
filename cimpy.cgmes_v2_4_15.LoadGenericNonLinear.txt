***********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.LoadGenericNonLinear.LoadGenericNonLinear(genericNonLinearLoadModelType=None, pt=0.0, qt=0.0, tp=0, tq=0, ls=0.0, lt=0.0, bs=0.0, bt=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      These load models (known also as generic non-linear dynamic
      (GNLD) load models) can be used in mid-term and long-term
      voltage stability simulations (i.e., to study voltage collapse),
      as they can replace a more detailed representation of aggregate
      load, including induction motors, thermostatically controlled
      and static loads.

      genericNonLinearLoadModelType:
         Type of generic non-linear load model. Default: None

      pt:
         Dynamic portion of active load (P). Default: 0.0

      qt:
         Dynamic portion of reactive load (Q). Default: 0.0

      tp:
         Time constant of lag function of active power (T). Default: 0

      tq:
         Time constant of lag function of reactive power (T). Default:
         0

      ls:
         Steady state voltage index for active power (LS). Default:
         0.0

      lt:
         Transient voltage index for active power (LT). Default: 0.0

      bs:
         Steady state voltage index for reactive power (BS). Default:
         0.0

      bt:
         Transient voltage index for reactive power (BT). Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class LoadDynamics:

      Load whose behaviour is described by reference to a standard
      model   A standard feature of dynamic load behaviour modelling
      is the ability to associate the same behaviour to multiple
      energy consumers by means of a single aggregate load definition.
      Aggregate loads are used to represent all or part of the real
      and reactive load from one or more loads in the static (power
      flow) data. This load is usually the aggregation of many
      individual load devices and the load model is approximate
      representation of the aggregate response of the load devices to
      system disturbances. The load model is always applied to
      individual bus loads (energy consumers) but a single set of load
      model parameters can used for all loads in the grouping.

      EnergyConsumer:
         Energy consumer to which this dynamics load model applies.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
