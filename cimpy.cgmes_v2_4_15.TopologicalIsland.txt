cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TopologicalIsland module
********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TopologicalIsland.TopologicalIsland(AngleRefTopologicalNode=None, TopologicalNodes='list', *args, **kw_args)

      An electrically connected subset of the network. Topological
      islands can change as the current network state changes: e.g.
      due to  - disconnect switches or breakers change state in a
      SCADA/EMS - manual creation, change or deletion of topological
      nodes in a planning tool.

      AngleRefTopologicalNode:
         The angle reference for the island.   Normally there is one
         TopologicalNode that is selected as the angle reference for
         each island.   Other reference schemes exist, so the
         association is typically optional. Default: None

      TopologicalNodes:
         A topological node belongs to a topological island. Default:
         "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
