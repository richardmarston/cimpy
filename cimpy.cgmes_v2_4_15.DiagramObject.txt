class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.DiagramObject.DiagramObject(Diagram=None, drawingOrder=0, isPolygon=False, offsetX=0.0, offsetY=0.0, rotation=0.0, IdentifiedObject=None, DiagramObjectPoints='list', VisibilityLayers='list', DiagramObjectStyle=None, *args, **kw_args)

      An object that defines one or more points in a given space. This
      object can be associated with anything that specializes
      IdentifiedObject. For single line diagrams such objects
      typically include such items as analog values, breakers,
      disconnectors, power transformers, and transmission lines.

      Diagram:
         A diagram object is part of a diagram. Default: None

      drawingOrder:
         The drawing order of this element. The higher the number, the
         later the element is drawn in sequence. This is used to
         ensure that elements that overlap are rendered in the correct
         order. Default: 0

      isPolygon:
         Defines whether or not the diagram objects points define the
         boundaries of a polygon or the routing of a polyline. If this
         value is true then a receiving application should consider
         the first and last points to be connected. Default: False

      offsetX:
         The offset in the X direction. This is used for defining the
         offset from centre for rendering an icon (the default is that
         a single point specifies the centre of the icon).  The offset
         is in per-unit with 0 indicating there is no offset from the
         horizontal centre of the icon.  -0.5 indicates it is offset
         by 50% to the left and 0.5 indicates an offset of 50% to the
         right. Default: 0.0

      offsetY:
         The offset in the Y direction. This is used for defining the
         offset from centre for rendering an icon (the default is that
         a single point specifies the centre of the icon).  The offset
         is in per-unit with 0 indicating there is no offset from the
         vertical centre of the icon.  The offset direction is
         dependent on the orientation of the diagram, with -0.5 and
         0.5 indicating an offset of +/- 50% on the vertical axis.
         Default: 0.0

      rotation:
         Sets the angle of rotation of the diagram object.  Zero
         degrees is pointing to the top of the diagram.  Rotation is
         clockwise. Default: 0.0

      IdentifiedObject:
         The diagram objects that are associated with the domain
         object. Default: None

      DiagramObjectPoints:
         A diagram object can have 0 or more points to reflect its
         layout position, routing (for polylines) or boundary (for
         polygons). Default: "list"

      VisibilityLayers:
         A diagram object can be part of multiple visibility layers.
         Default: "list"

      DiagramObjectStyle:
         A diagram object has a style associated that provides a
         reference for the style used in the originating system.
         Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
