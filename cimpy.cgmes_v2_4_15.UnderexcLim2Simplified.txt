class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.UnderexcLim2Simplified.UnderexcLim2Simplified(q0=0.0, q1=0.0, p0=0.0, p1=0.0, kui=0.0, vuimin=0.0, vuimax=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      This model can be derived from UnderexcLimIEEE2. The limit
      characteristic (look -up table) is a single straight-line, the
      same as UnderexcLimIEEE2 (see Figure 10.4 (p 32), IEEE
      421.5-2005 Section 10.2).

      q0:
         Segment Q initial point (Q0).  Typical Value = -0.31.
         Default: 0.0

      q1:
         Segment Q end point (Q1).  Typical Value = -0.1. Default: 0.0

      p0:
         Segment P initial point (P0).  Typical Value = 0. Default:
         0.0

      p1:
         Segment P end point (P1).  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0

      kui:
         Gain Under excitation limiter (Kui).  Typical Value = 0.1.
         Default: 0.0

      vuimin:
         Minimum error signal (V).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      vuimax:
         Maximum error signal (V).  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class UnderexcitationLimiterDynamics:

      Underexcitation limiter function block whose behaviour is
      described by reference to a standard model

      RemoteInputSignal:
         Remote input signal used by this underexcitation limiter
         model. Default: None

      ExcitationSystemDynamics:
         Excitation system model with which this underexcitation
         limiter model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
