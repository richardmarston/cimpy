      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC8B model. This
      model represents a PID voltage regulator with either a brushless
      exciter or dc exciter. The AVR in this model consists of PID
      control, with separate constants for the proportional (),
      integral (), and derivative () gains. The representation of the
      brushless exciter (, , , , ) is similar to the model Type AC2A.
      The Type AC8B model can be used to represent static voltage
      regulators applied to brushless excitation systems. Digitally
      based voltage regulators feeding dc rotating main exciters can
      be represented with the AC Type AC8B model with the parameters
      and  set to 0.  For thyristor power stages fed from the
      generator terminals, the limits  and  should be a function of
      terminal voltage:  * and  * .     Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 6.8.

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
