      General governor model with frequency-dependent fuel flow limit.
      This model is a modification of the GovCT1model in order to
      represent the frequency-dependent fuel flow limit of a specific
      gas turbine manufacturer.

      mwbase:
         Base for power values (MWbase) (> 0).  Unit = MW. Default:
         0.0

      r:
         Permanent droop (R).  Typical Value = 0.05. Default: 0.0

      rselect:
         Feedback signal for droop (Rselect).  Typical Value =
         electricalPower. Default: None

         = -1. Default: 0.0

         Default: 0.0

      vmin:

         Default: 0.0

      tact:
         Actuator time constant (Tact).  Typical Value = 0.4. Default:
         0

      kturb:
         Turbine gain (Kturb).  Typical Value = 1.9168. Default: 0.0

      wfnl:
         No load fuel flow (Wfnl).  Typical Value = 0.187. Default:

         Turbine lead time constant (Tc).  Typical Value = 0. Default:
         0

      wfspd:
         Switch for fuel source characteristic to recognize that fuel
         flow, for a given fuel valve stroke, can be proportional to
         engine speed (Wfspd). true = fuel flow proportional to speed
         (for some gas turbines and diesel engines with positive
         displacement fuel injectors) false = fuel control system
         keeps fuel flow independent of engine speed. Typical Value =
         false. Default: False

      teng:
         Transport time delay for diesel engine used in representing
         diesel engines where there is a small but measurable
         transport delay between a change in fuel flow setting and the
         development of torque (Teng).  Teng should be zero in all but
         special cases where this transport delay is of particular

      ldref:
         Load limiter reference value (Ldref).  Typical Value = 1.
         Default: 0.0

      dm:
         Speed sensitivity coefficient (Dm).  Dm can represent either
         the variation of the engine power with the shaft speed or the
         variation of maximum power capability with shaft speed.  If
         it is positive it describes the falling slope of the engine
         speed verses power characteristic as speed increases. A
         slightly falling characteristic is typical for reciprocating
         engines and some aero-derivative turbines.  If it is negative
         the engine power is assumed to be unaffected by the shaft
         speed, but the maximum permissible fuel flow is taken to fall
         with falling shaft speed. This is characteristic of single-
         shaft industrial turbines due to exhaust temperature limits.
         Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

         Maximum valve opening rate (Ropen).  Unit = PU/sec.  Typical

         Minimum valve closing rate (Rclose).  Unit = PU/sec.  Typical
         Value = -99. Default: 0.0

      kimw:
         Power controller (reset) gain (Kimw).  The default value of
         0.01 corresponds to a reset time of 100 seconds.  A value of
         0.001 corresponds to a relatively slow acting load
         controller.  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0

      aset:
         Acceleration limiter setpoint (Aset).  Unit = PU/sec.
         Typical Value = 10. Default: 0.0

         Default: 0

      db:

         be set to zero.  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0
