class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ExcIEEEDC1A.ExcIEEEDC1A(ka=0.0, ta=0, tb=0, tc=0, vrmax=0.0, vrmin=0.0, ke=0.0, te=0, kf=0.0, tf=0, efd1=0.0, seefd1=0.0, efd2=0.0, seefd2=0.0, uelin=False, exclim=False, *args, **kw_args)

      The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type DC1A model. This
      model represents field-controlled dc commutator exciters with
      continuously acting voltage regulators (especially the direct-
      acting rheostatic, rotating amplifier, and magnetic amplifier
      types).  Because this model has been widely implemented by the
      industry, it is sometimes used to represent other types of
      systems when detailed data for them are not available or when a
      simplified model is required.   Reference: IEEE Standard
      421.5-2005 Section 5.1.

         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
