class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.WindContCurrLimIEC.WindContCurrLimIEC(imax=0.0, imaxdip=0.0, mdfslim=False, mqpri=False, tufilt=0, WindTurbineType3or4IEC=None, WindDynamicsLookupTable='list', *args, **kw_args)

      Current limitation model.  The current limitation model combines
      the physical limits.  Reference: IEC Standard 61400-27-1 Section
      6.6.5.7.

      imax:
         Maximum continuous current at the wind turbine terminals ().
         It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      imaxdip:
         Maximum current during voltage dip at the wind turbine
         terminals (). It is project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      mdfslim:
         Limitation of type 3 stator current  ():  - false=0: total
         current limitation,  - true=1: stator current limitation).
         It is type dependent parameter. Default: False

      mqpri:
         Prioritisation of q control during LVRT (): - true = 1:
         reactive power priority, - false = 0: active power priority.
         It is project dependent parameter. Default: False

      tufilt:
         Voltage measurement filter time constant (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

      WindTurbineType3or4IEC:
         Wind turbine type 3 or 4 model with which this wind control
         current limitation model is associated. Default: None

      WindDynamicsLookupTable:
         The current control limitation model with which this wind
         dynamics lookup table is associated. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
