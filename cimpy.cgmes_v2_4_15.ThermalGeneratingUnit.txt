class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.ThermalGeneratingUnit.ThermalGeneratingUnit(FossilFuels='list', *args, **kw_args)

      A generating unit whose prime mover could be a steam turbine,
      combustion turbine, or diesel engine.

      FossilFuels:
         A thermal generating unit may have one or more fossil fuels.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class GeneratingUnit:

      A single or set of synchronous machines for converting
      mechanical power into alternating-current power. For example,
      individual machines within a set may be defined for scheduling
      purposes while a single control signal is derived for the set.
      In this case there would be a GeneratingUnit for each member of
      the set and an additional GeneratingUnit corresponding to the
      set.

      genControlSource:
         The source of controls for a generating unit. Default: None

      governorSCD:
         Governor Speed Changer Droop.   This is the change in
         generator power output divided by the change in frequency
         normalized by the nominal power of the generator and the
         nominal frequency and expressed in percent and negated. A
         positive value of speed change droop provides additional
         generator output upon a drop in frequency. Default: 0.0

      initialP:
         Default initial active power  which is used to store a
         powerflow result for the initial active power for this unit
         in this network configuration. Default: 0.0

         Generating unit long term economic participation factor.
         Default: 0.0

      maximumAllowableSpinningReserve:
         Maximum allowable spinning reserve. Spinning reserve will
         never be considered greater than this value regardless of the
         current operating point. Default: 0.0

      maxOperatingP:
         This is the maximum operating active power limit the
         dispatcher can enter for this unit. Default: 0.0

      minOperatingP:
         This is the minimum operating active power limit the
         dispatcher can enter for this unit. Default: 0.0

      nominalP:
         The nominal power of the generating unit.  Used to give
         precise meaning to percentage based attributes such as the
         governor speed change droop (governorSCD attribute). The
         attribute shall be a positive value equal or less than
         RotatingMachine.ratedS. Default: 0.0

      ratedGrossMaxP:
         The unit`s gross rated maximum capacity (book value).
         Default: 0.0

      ratedGrossMinP:
         The gross rated minimum generation level which the unit can
         safely operate at while delivering power to the transmission
         grid. Default: 0.0

      ratedNetMaxP:
         The net rated maximum capacity determined by subtracting the
         auxiliary power used to operate the internal plant machinery
         from the rated gross maximum capacity. Default: 0.0

      shortPF:
         Generating unit short term economic participation factor.
         Default: 0.0

      startupCost:
         The initial startup cost incurred for each start of the
         GeneratingUnit. Default: 0.0

      variableCost:
         The variable cost component of production per unit of
         ActivePower. Default: 0.0

      totalEfficiency:
         The efficiency of the unit in converting the fuel into
         electrical energy. Default: 0.0

      ControlAreaGeneratingUnit:
         ControlArea specifications for this generating unit. Default:
         "list"

      RotatingMachine:
         A synchronous machine may operate as a generator and as such
         becomes a member of a generating unit. Default: "list"

      GrossToNetActivePowerCurves:
         A generating unit may have a gross active power to net active
         power curve, describing the losses and auxiliary power
         requirements of the unit. Default: "list"

      normalPF:
         Generating unit economic participation factor. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class Equipment:

      The parts of a power system that are physical devices,
      electronic or mechanical.

      aggregate:
         The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces
         of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.
         Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines
         operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power
         transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to
         be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of
         interdependent equipment produced by a network production
         program. Default: False

      EquipmentContainer:
         Container of this equipment. Default: None

      OperationalLimitSet:
         The operational limit sets associated with this equipment.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
