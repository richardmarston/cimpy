class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.WindTurbineType1or2IEC.WindTurbineType1or2IEC(WindMechIEC=None, WindProtectionIEC=None, *args, **kw_args)

      Generator model for wind turbine of IEC Type 1 or Type 2 is a
      standard asynchronous generator model.  Reference: IEC Standard
      614000-27-1 Section 6.6.3.1.

      WindMechIEC:
         Wind mechanical model associated with this wind generator
         type 1 or 2 model. Default: None

      WindProtectionIEC:
         Wind turbune protection model associated with this wind
         generator type 1 or 2 model. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class WindTurbineType1or2Dynamics:

      Parent class supporting relationships to wind turbines Type 1
      and 2 and their control models.

      RemoteInputSignal:
         Remote input signal used by this wind generator Type 1 or
         Type 2 model. Default: None

      AsynchronousMachineDynamics:
         Asynchronous machine model with which this wind generator
         type 1 or 2 model is associated. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class DynamicsFunctionBlock:

      Abstract parent class for all Dynamics function blocks.

      enabled:
         Function block used indicator. true = use of function block
         is enabled false = use of function block is disabled.
         Default: False

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
