***************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.PetersenCoil.PetersenCoil(mode=None, nominalU=0.0, offsetCurrent=0.0, positionCurrent=0.0, xGroundMax=0.0, xGroundMin=0.0, xGroundNominal=0.0, *args, **kw_args)

      A tunable impedance device normally used to offset line charging
      during single line faults in an ungrounded section of network.

      mode:
         The mode of operation of the Petersen coil. Default: None

      nominalU:
         The nominal voltage for which the coil is designed. Default:
         0.0

      offsetCurrent:
         The offset current that the Petersen coil controller is
         operating from the resonant point.  This is normally a fixed
         amount for which the controller is configured and could be
         positive or negative.  Typically 0 to 60 Amperes depending on
         voltage and resonance conditions. Default: 0.0

      positionCurrent:
         The control current used to control the Petersen coil also
         known as the position current.  Typically in the range of
         20-200mA. Default: 0.0

      xGroundMax:
         The maximum reactance. Default: 0.0

      xGroundMin:
         The minimum reactance. Default: 0.0

      xGroundNominal:
         The nominal reactance.  This is the operating point (normally
         over compensation) that is defined based on the resonance
         point in the healthy network condition.  The impedance is
         calculated based on nominal voltage divided by position
         current. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class EarthFaultCompensator:

      A conducting equipment used to represent a connection to ground
      which is typically used to compensate earth faults..   An earth
      fault compensator device modeled with a single terminal implies
      a second terminal solidly connected to ground.  If two terminals
      are modeled, the ground is not assumed and normal connection
      rules apply.

      r:
         Nominal resistance of device. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class ConductingEquipment:

      The parts of the AC power system that are designed to carry
      current or that are conductively connected through terminals.

      BaseVoltage:
         All conducting equipment with this base voltage.  Use only
         when there is no voltage level container used and only one
         base voltage applies.  For example, not used for
         transformers. Default: None

      Terminals:
         Conducting equipment have terminals that may be connected to
         other conducting equipment terminals via connectivity nodes
         or topological nodes. Default: "list"

      SvStatus:
         The status state variable associated with this conducting
         equipment. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class Equipment:

      The parts of a power system that are physical devices,
      electronic or mechanical.

      aggregate:
         The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces
         of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.
         Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines
         operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power
         transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to
         be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of
         interdependent equipment produced by a network production
         program. Default: False

      EquipmentContainer:
         Container of this equipment. Default: None

      OperationalLimitSet:
         The operational limit sets associated with this equipment.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.
         Default: "list"

      Location:
         Location of this power system resource. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
