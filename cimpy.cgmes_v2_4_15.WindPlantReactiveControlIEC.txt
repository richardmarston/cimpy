      Simplified plant voltage and reactive power control model for
      use with type 3 and type 4 wind turbine models.  Reference: IEC
      Standard 61400-27-1 Annex E.

      WindPlantIEC:
         Wind plant model with which this wind reactive control is
         associated. Default: None

      kiwpx:
         Plant Q controller integral gain (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      kpwpx:
         Plant Q controller proportional gain (). It is type dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      kwpqu:
         Plant voltage control droop (). It is project dependent
         parameter. Default: 0.0

      mwppf:
         Power factor control modes selector (). Used only if mwpu is
         set to false. true = 1: power factor control false = 0:
         reactive power control. It is project dependent parameter.
         Default: False

      mwpu:
         Reactive power control modes selector (). true = 1: voltage
         control false = 0: reactive power control. It is project
         dependent parameter. Default: False

      twppfilt:
         Filter time constant for active power measurement (). It is
         type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      twpqfilt:
         Filter time constant for reactive power measurement (). It is
         type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      twpufilt:
         Filter time constant for voltage measurement (). It is type
         dependent parameter. Default: 0

      txft:
         Lead time constant in reference value transfer function ().
         It is type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      txfv:
         Lag time constant in reference value transfer function (). It
         is type dependent parameter. Default: 0

      uwpqdip:
         Voltage threshold for LVRT detection in q control (). It is
         type dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      xrefmax:
         Maximum  ( or delta ) request from the plant controller ().
         It is project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

      xrefmin:
         Minimum  ( or delta) request from the plant controller (). It
         is project dependent parameter. Default: 0.0

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
