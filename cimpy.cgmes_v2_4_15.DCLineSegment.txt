****************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.DCLineSegment.DCLineSegment(capacitance=0.0, inductance=0.0, resistance=0.0, length=0.0, PerLengthParameter=None, *args, **kw_args)

      A wire or combination of wires not insulated from one another,
      with consistent electrical characteristics, used to carry direct
      current between points in the DC region of the power system.

      capacitance:
         Capacitance of the DC line segment. Significant for cables
         only. Default: 0.0

      inductance:
         Inductance of the DC line segment. Neglectable compared with
         DCSeriesDevice used for smoothing. Default: 0.0

      resistance:
         Resistance of the DC line segment. Default: 0.0

      length:
         Segment length for calculating line section capabilities.
         Default: 0.0

      PerLengthParameter:
         Set of per-length parameters for this line segment. Default:
         None

   Documentation of parent class DCConductingEquipment:

      The parts of the DC power system that are designed to carry
      current or that are conductively connected through DC terminals.

      DCTerminals:
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class Equipment:

      The parts of a power system that are physical devices,
      electronic or mechanical.

      aggregate:
         The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces
         of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.
         Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines
         operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power
         transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to
         be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of
         interdependent equipment produced by a network production
         program. Default: False

      EquipmentContainer:
         Container of this equipment. Default: None

      OperationalLimitSet:
         The operational limit sets associated with this equipment.
         Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.
         Default: "list"

      Location:
         Location of this power system resource. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
