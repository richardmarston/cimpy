********************************************

class cimpy.cgmes_v2_4_15.TapChangerControl.TapChangerControl(TapChanger='list', *args, **kw_args)

      Describes behavior specific to tap changers, e.g. how the
      voltage at the end of a line varies with the load level and
      compensation of the voltage drop by tap adjustment.

      TapChanger:
         The regulating control scheme in which this tap changer
         participates. Default: "list"

   Documentation of parent class RegulatingControl:

      Specifies a set of equipment that works together to control a
      power system quantity such as voltage or flow.  Remote bus
      voltage control is possible by specifying the controlled
      terminal located at some place remote from the controlling
      equipment. In case multiple equipment, possibly of different
      types, control same terminal there must be only one
      RegulatingControl at that terminal. The most specific subtype of
      RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment
      participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap
      changers. For flow control  load sign convention is used, i.e.
      positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into
      the conducting equipment.

      Terminal:
         The controls regulating this terminal. Default: None

      RegulatingCondEq:
         The equipment that participates in this regulating control
         scheme. Default: "list"

      mode:
         The regulating control mode presently available.  This
         specification allows for determining the kind of regulation
         without need for obtaining the units from a schedule.
         Default: None

      RegulationSchedule:
         Schedule for this Regulating regulating control. Default:
         "list"

      discrete:
         The regulation is performed in a discrete mode. This applies
         to equipment with discrete controls, e.g. tap changers and
         shunt compensators. Default: False

      enabled:
         The flag tells if regulation is enabled. Default: False

      targetDeadband:
         This is a deadband used with discrete control to avoid
         excessive update of controls like tap changers and shunt
         compensator banks while regulating. The units of those
         appropriate for the mode. Default: 0.0

      targetValue:
         The target value specified for case input.   This value can
         be used for the target value without the use of schedules.
         The value has the units appropriate to the mode attribute.
         Default: 0.0

      targetValueUnitMultiplier:
         Specify the multiplier for used for the targetValue. Default:
         None

   Documentation of parent class PowerSystemResource:

      A power system resource can be an item of equipment such as a
      switch, an equipment container containing many individual items
      of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity
      such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have
      measurements associated.

      Controls:
         Regulating device governed by this control output. Default:
         "list"

      Measurements:
         The power system resource that contains the measurement.
         Default: "list"

      Location:
         Location of this power system resource. Default: None

   Documentation of parent class IdentifiedObject:

      This is a root class to provide common identification for all
      classes needing identification and naming attributes.

      DiagramObjects:
         The domain object to which this diagram object is associated.
         Default: "list"

      mRID:
         Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The
         mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global
         uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified
         in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly
         recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming
         to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or
         rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
         Default: ''

      name:
         The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique
         text naming the object. Default: ''

      description:
         The description is a free human readable text describing or
         naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate
         to a naming hierarchy. Default: ''

      energyIdentCodeEic:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of the EIC code (Energy
         identification Code). The length of the string is 16
         characters as defined by the EIC code. References: Default:
         ''

      shortName:
         The attribute is used for an exchange of a human readable
         short name with length of the string 12 characters maximum.
         Default: ''
